I really enjoyed the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” because it really helped showcase how humankind cannot help but constantly want more stuff. Although I have never seen this movie before, I have heard of the idea of Minimalism, I never fully understood why someone would partake in it until now. We are wired to love the first new object like a pair of shoes, but once we get tired of those shoes we decide to buy more. Unfortunately, no matter how many things we buy it will not make us happy. In reality, having all of this stuff and empty space in our homes makes us more anxious and less happy because we feel the need to fill those spaces, and because of society, we feel the need to constantly have the best/newest stuff. It is really inspiring to see so many people live happy lives with such a minimal number of things, which to many seems like a joke. I used to shop and buy new clothes or random objects just because I felt like it, but as I got older I realized that these things were not only a waste of money, but they were a waste of space and would eventually be thrown away (usually barely used). Although I know it would be very hard to start living with less and having to decide what I truly need and don’t need, but after watching this documentary it really has opened my eyes to what all this stuff really means to me. I look around my room and see things I use daily sometimes multiple times a day, but then there are objects that have literally been pushed away and buried in my closet that I forgot I even own. I am glad I saw this movie because it will help me get rid of things as well as help me make smarter choices for myself and the environment.

I completely agree with you. The more things we get the more we want. Life happiness today is measured in wealth. The documentary does a phenomenal job of displaying how mass media continuously encourages materialism. Other more important things in life are ignored and this deeply saddens me. America's living ways have gotten out of control and have impeded individuals from focusing on anything that is not-materialistic.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I really appreciated your comment because it really resonated with me. While I can appreciate this film and how these people live, I know I could not just pick 33 items and get rid of the rest. BUT I do feel inspired to throw out a few things and make smarter choices for myself and the environment. I understand how advertising can pressure and persuade people into buying things and how the 'American dream' can influence the way people live their lives. But I don't think that people need to throw out more than half their items and/or move into a small house. I think Minimalism is more of a persona type. I don't think it is a lifestyle for everyone. But I do think everyone can learn from this film, and hopefully give more thought to what they're buying. Lastly, while I understand that being a minimalist can be more beneficial to the environment and help climate change, I feel like this would be one of the toughest message/change to get across the average American.

I really liked how in your comment about how society has hardwired us to have the best, and more importantly the newest items available to us. In my own home, my mother and my sister are classic "shopaholics" in the sence that they use shopping and/or spending money in order to fill a void they may be feeling in their lives. This phenomenon is very common and is one aspect of the hoarder-like society we live in today. In other words, many people literally abuse the rush of endorphins that arises when shopping as if it were a drug. While this is an addiction that is all to easy to have in today's society, it does not account for all of the consumerism we see today. For individuals like myself, who do not get the same pleasure from shopping as a shopaholic, it is the pressure to have the latest and the greatest that fuels our unabridged consumerism. To elaborate, I consider myself a bit of a minimalist, I don't waste money on tons of clothes or nick-nacks that clutter my living space; I do, however, rush to the apple store to buy the newest iphone even though mine is perfectly functional. This is important because it allows consumerism to hide under the guise of minimalism. Sure I only have a few items in my room, and of course all of them are immensely useful, however, they are all brand new and probably wont make it through the year. This is what is so frustrating about capitalism today, especially in the electronic industry. Some companies, such as Apple, even go so far as to make products which are outdated by more than 2 years less functional via software updates in order to force its consumers to buy the newest model. Things are no longer built to last because that would make the turnover rate of any given item much slower on the market. Even if we stop consumerism from the perspective of the buyer, the source will continue to shrink the life cycle of any given product.

I like how you put that no matter how many things we buy, they will never make us happy. I often also buy clothes or shoes or just any new things because I feel like it or because I just want something pretty and new in my closet. Not to exaggerate, but it's honestly kind of an addiction. I'll just be walking downtown to get ice cream and next thing you know, I'm going shopping and buying way more than I even have space for at home. I truly believe that if we just lived minimally, we would save so much space and money and time. The film did a really good job of explaining minimalism and helped me understand why it is a better lifestyle choice. It's important that we don't get too caught up in the material things, because they will never satisfy us deep down inside.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I totally agree with your idea about the film. This film is a really good one, that clearly shows us the process of being a minimalist to find real happiness. I was really surprised by the 10 month stuff the take in the film. I can never imagine to travel with such few things for 10 month. This is incredible. In fact, this is not the first time I learn about the idea about minimalism. There is a kind of similar idea of minimalism in ancient China to find peace and happiness, but it is not as practical as what is said in this film.
<br><br>
Actually, today, we really buy too much things that we may not use very often. From my perspective, the incentive of this is to make our own life more comfortable. However, the extra things we buy is really a waste of resource. Moreover, after learning this course, I find out that the production of this things is emits great amount of green house gases, which may cause climate crisis. Thus, stopping buying the unneeded things is important.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I completely agree that this message has a great impact on us as college students since we are the product of western culture and advertising to children. I have always had a lot of clothes toys and just a lot of stuff, but whenever I minimize it by any amount I would feel so much more relief. I don’t think it was the environmental aspect that was so effective in this video though. Sure, they mentioned pressing issues involved with having stuff, like waste and cheapening of clothes causing unnecessary amounts of resources being used to make them and other objects. Another issue mentioned was the environmental cost to ship goods, releasing CO2 into the air. While these are good reasons to pursue minimalism, the hope of finally being satisfied is the most appealing aspect of their argument. The hope of being at peace with having enough and ridding ourselves of unneeded stress. We as college student especially don’t need any more stress than is necessary. I liked the point made by the reporter, we can worry, but it doesn’t do anything to worry too much. Overall I was very moved by the argument for a minimalist lifestyle in the Minimalism documentary. Going forward I will really think if an object will add value, does it have meaning to me, and do I have enough and not too much? If we can all minimize our footprint by buying less, we are taking the first step to saving our environment. So, who else is purging?
<br><br><Hr><br>
I agree with the points you bring up in your comment. A lot of the stuff we have, doesn't truly make us happier. The stuff we strive to have is the root of our suffering. 
<br><br>
To answer Ken’s question posed at the end of the video, while I certainly think that minimalism is admirable and should be strived for, I remain extremely skeptical that a majority, or even a minority, of us will convert. The minimalism school of thought runs completely counter to the tenets of American Dream. I cannot imagine trying to convince our fellow countrymen to give up everything they have worked for, and everything they strive for. While this materialism will likely not make people happier, many people, myself not excluded, are under the illusion that “stuff” will make our lives better. 
<br><br>
One quote I really liked from the documentary was  “As humans we are wired to become dissatisfied.” I believe it is absolutely true due to our adaptive nature. The same adaptive nature was likely a massive boon when we were living in the wilderness, but now with modern society it creates drawbacks. We are biologically programmed to not ever simply just be happy with what we have. We are fighting our nature by trying to live with, and for, less. Watching the documentary, the two “main characters” remind me very much of some students I see here on campus. I feel that these two guys reflect a very similar mentality to that I see here on campus when I look around. Another quote I identified with a lot was “minimalism is not a radical lifestyle, I believe in quality over quantity.” It is true. One nice piece of quality clothing, is a lot better than six pairs of trash quality. The section about constructive anguish rung true to me. Often as a student I find myself worrying, am I going to do ok on this test, am I prepared enough, am I going to fail? But after a certain point, the worry becomes less constructive and a lot more detrimental.
<br><br><hr><Br>
The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the important Things" portrays an idea that our life can actually be better when we have less. By giving us an inside of what life is like for a number of minimalists of a variety of professions and life experiences. What got my attention in this movie is that is focuses on living intentionally and deliberately and that experiences are much better when it comes to achieving happiness than material things.
<br><br>
However, I don't think the documentary did a good job at persuading the audience. I think it can go a little bit deeper when showing the audience the benefits of being a minimalist.
<br><br><hr><Br>
Its really motivating to see people like yourself beginning to move in the direction of Minimalism that the film discusses. I like a lot of the points you make, and I wholeheartedly agree with your observations of consumer culture today, especially in the United States. In the past couple of decades the world has become a truly global one, and this is very evident in how we can get a product or service from halfway across the world in such a short amount of time. With this development, however, the rise of consumerism today has reached unprecedented levels that go way beyond what people need and what people want. As you mention, society today has placed significant emphasis on the importance of material goods. Growing up in an environment that places overwhelming pressure on what is 'new' and 'trendy' leaves us feeling like we need to continue consuming when we really don't. I like how you mention how fast we get tired of these 'new' objects and quickly replace them, creating a ton of waste as a result. This desire for more that American culture is cultivating in the 21st Century is so dangerous because it doesn't stop. No matter how much you have, you will be left feeling like you need more, and you will not be happy until you have it; but, once you do finally get that diamond necklace or new car, the cycle will continue. I have always been someone who recognizes that there a lot of things I want, but I don't need. While I can't say that I always refrain from purchasing things that I want, I can say that I think I do a good job of remaining relatively minimal. I hope that over the coming years that people can start to break this cycle, and I think a big part of that falls on corporations that are the ones selling us unnecessary and cheap products. They need to start focusing on quality and durability over quantity, but I worry that many companies will avoid this for as long as possible because it does not produce as much profit.
<br><br><hr><Br>
I like how you have addressed the problem, but I have to disagree with the statement “humankind cannot help but constantly want more stuff.” I think we need to take the blame largely off the individual and rightly place it on the corporations that create the system. Corporations are to blame time and time again for the cultural issue in the developed world of compulsory consumption. Yes, it is ultimately the individual who buys the product, but it is the company that lures you in and hides all the skeletons in the closet of their unethical labor practices, and environmental degradation. 
<br><br>
However, while the creation of the consumption habits is the fault of corporations and tricky marketing tactics, it is up to the consumer to change the way they buy while also calling out the companies. Because so much the issue is one of supply and demand, it is the responsibility of those who can afford to change their lifestyle. This will decrease the demand for the products which will signal to the companies that their products are no longer of value to their target audience.
<br><br><hr><Br>
I totally agree with your comment. I have also been doubtful of minimalism before because it seems like such a different concept from afar. However, after watching the short videos and movie from this week, I can see why people turn to minimalism. Society and advertisements have taught us that material objects are what makes us happy. Thus, many people spend needless amounts of money to purchase material items with the thought that it’ll make them happy. I, too, often spend money to buy random items that I never end up using. These objects often get thrown out without being used, which is not only wasteful, but it did not contribute to the happiness in my life. That is why I really love the films from this week as it not only addresses how materialism affects our environment, but also how it makes us live less fulfilled lives in general. 
 <br><br>
 I also love how minimalism is such an accessible way to change the way you live to help the environment. It is simply not purchasing things you don’t need and cutting down. I really like how the films addressed how not only does purchasing so many things not make you happy, it, in fact, makes you more depressed and unhappy. Buying things to make yourself happy, and being disappointed after you don’t get the expected results makes materialism such a downward spiral for people. I think it is so important for us to realize this and stop giving into the consumerism that is being promoted by all the companies and society. We need to find our own happiness through other means, and focus on what is really important in our lives, such as our family and friends. I think this realization will not only make people happier in general, but also pave the way to creating a greener earth for us all.
<br><br><hr><Br>
I relate to your statements since I too never really thought anyone would want to become a minimalist. Before this movie, I thought that stuff could bring joy but not to as big of an extent as other people thought it would bring. I personally love to collect video games and Harley Quinn figurines and these definitely bring me joy through the hours of gameplay and cleaning my figurines. However, I know that other things such as my little trinkets on my desk or some of my clothes do not bring me joy for longer than a few weeks. It made me feel frustrated that the joy was lost so quickly and I too would buy things just because I felt like it. It led me to having so many things that I did not use and after a couple of years, I would finally donate it so that someone else could hopefully use it. This film though gave me a better look into minimalism and helped me connect the dots. How I saw minimalism was that the many things we buy to fill our void of sadness or emptiness are just little gophers that are really cute but eventually end up digging their way out leaving you with no cute gophers and now a bigger hole. I plan on trying to minimize the things I have but not as close to Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus' extreme. One of the things they said when talking about their lifestyle that stuck with me was “I don’t own a lot of clothes now, but all the clothes I do own are my favorite clothes.” That is how I plan to start my minimalism is to keep my favorite things and the functional things that I need on a daily basis. It was reassuring to hear that Joshua and Ryan have admitted that it’s not a bad thing to keep the things you collect and enjoy as long as you are more mindful of your other choices. Even by getting rid of just a handful of the things that are not of use to you anymore is better than forever adding to the pile of unused items we buy.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I agree with you. This documentary shows me the real life of a minimalist, not just the story written in books. I am really surprised by the difference between the minimalist and materialism. The minimalist has tried their best to maintain a living with minimum material requirement, but the materialist, which is what most people are right now, has constant desire of obtaining more and more stuff. I do admire those people who follow the minimalism. Some may believe that the life of minimalism is rough, inconvenient, and miserable, but this is not true. Most minimalists have the determination to protect the environment. It is incredible that they are not influenced by the consumerism in modern society.
<br><br>
I believe that all of us have the similar problems like you: buy new stuff on a daily basis, but barely use them. It is a waste of time and money, and most importantly, a waste of resources of the earth. This documentary just makes me realize that how much time I have wasted in searching for items I do not really need. This is almost impossible for me to lead a live as a minimalist in the film, but I will try to get close to them by buying less stuff, rethinking of the necessity before buying goods, and taking account.
<br><Br><hr><br>

thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! To be perfectly honest I was once one of those people who always want new products and think that it's cool and trendy to have things like, say the latest iPhone or the most popular outfits that everyone else is wearing at school. However, gradually I began to see that there was really no real point or significance in owning the latest iPhone or wearing the latest fashionable outfits. Sure you can go around and boast about them and show off, but that's pretty much it to the situation. Those products do not increase the happiness level in your life, nor would you feel more complete or whole with the ownership of those things. On the contrary, just like the documentary stated, you will feel more empty and void inside that you will quickly get sick of those products and turn to the newer, better products marketed by those companies. For this I am really grateful to my father who I can confidently say is more of a minimalist than myself, and he taught me that what really matters about the products is not their brands or prices but whether if they are useful and can last for a fairly long amount of time. We don't really need to go shopping every two weeks just to catch up with the latest fashion trend because we just need the daily basic necessities for our lives, and as long as our basic daily needs are met with those essential products, we shouldn't worry about buying more things that we don't really need and which can only add up our carbon footprint on the planet. We should really focus on gaining a sense of purpose and significance in our lives through pursuing our passions, helping the needed, and maintaining close relationships with our loved ones because these are the things that can make us feel complete and human which the consumption of newer goods can never suffice.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I definitely agree with your comment. I am victim to this lifestyle as well from buying many things after a certain period of time. I think you use a great example with clothes/ shoes, that after a certain period of time after they have been used you want to get new items. In “Minimalism” they do a great job of influencing people to stop falling for wanting more and not everything revolves on getting new items. You can be just as happy without buying these new things. I really appreciate your comment because it made me realize I am not the only one that opinion has changed since watching the documentary. Your comment was very thoughtful and after reading it made my opinion even stronger.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I agree with your idea. I also have a lot of things that have been buried in the corner of my room for years and, like what you said, I forgot I even own those things. Especially in my childhood, I must collect every kind of toy car in a series and have new toys every week. However, they were all thrown away years ago when I attend middle school. I saw some other kinds of videos about something similar to "Minimalism", like moving to a really small house because the housing price was too high for some people to afford it. Honestly, I liked that kind of home and wished this kind of housing would become more popular in the future.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I like the way you think about things. I have the same thought like you when I first came to American when I attended high school here 4 years ago. I want to buy everything I like at that moment, even I know that thing is useless for me or I just like that thing for a few seconds, I may through it away after I bought it. I never think a while before I bought things, which make me waste a lot of money and things. After I got into high school, I start to control myself to buy things. I think I do quite well right now. If you have time, we may share our experience with this to each others.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I really agree as well. My whole family struggles with buying material things just for the sake of it. Wether it’s my sister buying new makeup she doesn’t need, my brother getting a new phone every month, or me buying junky food when I’m not even hungry. I’ve been trying to get my family to get rid of or donate things like clothes becuase we honestly start to hoard a lot things we don’t need. It really does come down to this consumerism mindset that is drilled into our brains since we were kids. And I wonder if the continuation of this mindset is becuase it benefits a few like the really rich to perpetuate it. But we aren’t cogs in a machine as society would like to tell us. We are free to design our own lives.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I completely agree with the feeling of inspiration when watching all of these people in the "Minimalism" film live the life of a minimalist. My mother and I are starting to actually take up a minimal approach to what we own, especially with our clothes and old papers that do not matter. However, we are still struggling to let some stuff go since we are so conditioned to hold onto stuff for "safe keepings". I know I struggle with letting some stuff go, especially with papers because I am led to believe that I "need them for later, I don't know when but I think I need it for the future". But in the end, in order to help the environment, our society needs to develop a minimal lifestyle, or at least don't give enough attention towards consumerism. 
<br><br>
What really opened my eyes with how many people here are willing to be open in doing a minimal lifestyle. It gives me some more optimism towards saving the earth and fixing the issue of climate change. Being able to get rid of stuff and developing a sense of a better lifestyle is an important factor for our livelihood is one amazing factor, being able to help the environment is a whole other plus side. Hopefully, from what I learn from the film, I can start applying those ideals-such as picking 33 items and not worrying about the expensive clothing- into my own life, so that way I can start being conscious of what I consume, what makes me happy, and what helps our environment
<br><Br><hr><br>

I liked your comment and agree that consumerism is all too prevalent in first-world societies. The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” really opened my eyes to this fact. I liked the approach the film took, not just following the two main protagonists, but also diving into the lives of scientists, journalists, architects and other well-off people who have chosen to adopt minimalism. Although I like the idea, I don’t believe that everyone has to follow such extreme minimalism as presented by Joshua and Ryan. I think for a lot of people finding a middle ground between minimalism and consumerism is the ideal place to be at. For example, I completely agree that working 40 hour work weeks just to save up for a fancy car is something of a waste. It’s what many believe will make them happy, but it probably won’t. In contrast, focusing on human connection, as the film suggests, is what will hopefully bring meaning and happiness to people’s lives. That doesn’t mean giving up everything except the absolute necessary though. For example, I own a huge collection of board games. I don’t need any of them, a lot of them have phased out of our group's cycle, but the experience they bring is worth the purchase, every single time. The same goes for shoes, I have four pairs, which may seem excessive, but I feel each pair serves a purpose. I have basketball and running shoes for sport, flip-flops for convincing, and a pair of vans for school. In my eyes, both too much and too little consumerism can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. In the same way, that consumerism becomes a competition with no winners, so can minimalism. Cutting out everything from your life because people tell you it’ll make you happy isn’t any better than constantly buying things to achieve happiness. That being said, I do like the overall message of the film and of your comment. People really should consider if the stuff they have is really worth having.
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree with your comment and can personally relate to it as well. If I were to check my closet one of these days I would find tons of clothes that I hardly use anymore. Or if i check my garage I would find objects I haven’t touched in years and are just sitting there. Honestly this film made me open my eyes and made me realize that I honestly don’t need a lot of the things I buy. Sure I go out and get necessary household items, but is that new pair of shoes really necessary? Is that new IPhone worth it when the one I currently have works in perfect condition. Those are things I must ask myself from now on when going shopping. Is this purchase a necessity or a temporary pleasure item? The film makes us realize that money doesn’t buy happiness at all. We can dream of being rich one day, but maybe living a simpler life can be more satisfying. I have always dreamt of having a nice sports car one day and that house of my dreams, but it has gotten to my attention that I might not even need all this space at all and could use my money for a better cause. “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” has made be realize that I must determine how my purchases affect society and my environment before I go out and spend. It does a great harm to our planet when he go out and spend ridiculous amount of money on things that won’t even be used and will be sitting there untouched like if they were in a museum.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with your comment. I also found it extremely interesting to see that people can live happy lives with very few things. I come from a poor family, so I am used to not having a lot, but even what we had was more than some of these minimalists have in their homes. Growing up I always thought that if I tried hard in life I would grow up, get a good job, and be able to buy myself anything I wanted. But I was also taught that material things won’t always make me happy and that I could be happy with the things I have. The question asked at the beginning of the movie made me really think about our lives in this day and age. People are more accessible to buy anything they want, yet they are so unhappy. I would like to one day try to live a minimalist life and see if I would be happier. Another part I found interesting was when the film talked about how brands went from only a few seasons a year to 54 seasons a year. Brands do this to make people feel like they are out of style and they need to buy more and more clothes to fit in. I believe it will be extremely hard for people to change the mindset of having to buy a bigger house and better cars to be able to feel successful. We have had this mindset for the longest time and people truly want these things that it will be hard for people to accept otherwise.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also really enjoyed the film. I felt it addressed a problem that is widely seen and familiar, especially to college students. Many students often buy things on Amazon that they do not necessarily need, but because it is so easy to access from the Isla Vista Amazon Locker. Like you said, we are wired to love a new object, and because of this, the wide selection available on Amazon allows students to conveniently obtain these new objects. 
<br><Br>
I have similar impulses, though not necessarily through shopping online. As a computer science student, I often attend and organize hackathons, where students code for hours on end while sponsors table and help. These sponsors usually bring “swag,” or free branded items to promote their company. Even though I already have many objects and clothes from these companies, I can’t resist grabbing a new pair of Microsoft socks or Google stickers. It is like you said, these honestly feel like a waste of space now. 
<br><br>
I don’t think I will put too much effort into deciding what to remove from my life, but I will put more thought into any things I want to buy or grab for free. I have seen how much waste a single package from Amazon creates, and consciously avoiding even one thing once in a while, I know I will make some difference.
<br><br><hr><br>
I second everything you have expressed because of the film. I believe that the film did an outstanding job inflicting a moral lesson to everyone that humanity will never be satisfied, we will always crave for something. we will always seek for our desires. In context, what you exemplify in the idea of buying a pair of shoes is accurately correct, our consumer world tend to glorify our short-term high or excitement when it comes to buying brand new things, whether that be because of the 'hard earned' paycheck we live every pay period or whether that be because we want to impress people around us, is truly showcasing an underrated statement that we are never satisfied and that our consumption to almost everything in our society, replicates the idea of a hamster wheel. We are trapped and blindly continuously seeking for our desires. As a result after watching the film, I am in the same boat as you in reversing my mindset when buying stuff and leaning more towards the question of 'What do I need' rather than 'What do I want'. The film has not only helped reflect ourselves in the mirror but it has contributed a spark, perhaps, a call of action in saving our planet.
<br><br><hr><br>
I personally agree with what you said about this film. I shows to audience that being a minimalist is a thing which is full of happiness. I start to notice that as our economy level develops rapidly, our desire and purchasing power increase dramatically. We always want to buy more than we actually need, and I also like that “no matter how many things we buy, they will never make us happy.” I understand that people are doing it can reflects their social status. However, this is pretty lethal to our Earth. Since producing clothes or any other daily necessities required a lot of energy, materials. Moreover, while factories are producing items, they also emits a lot of greenhouse gases to atmosphere, which will only make climate change worse. After I watched this film, I start to understand why minimalism is a better lifestyle, and the money saved from purchasing clothes and so on can be spend on other places which are more meaningful to us.
<br><br><hr><br>
After watching the film “Minimalist,” I realized that I am actually one of the people who likes to buy stuff to bring temporary happiness and a peace to our mind. Some people have stress eating problem, and I feel like I have stress buying problem at times. Especially on Black Friday, I bought more than I need, and now I still have many packing boxes piled up in my house, which is kind of ironic that I thought all those things would sooth my stress. Instead, over buying cost me more money and energy on browsing all kinds of websites. While watching the film, I think that I need to change my lifestyle. If we keep the most important part, we can still gain happiness. And in the meantime, we can minimize the waste and avoid over consumption, which also does good to our world.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also enjoyed this film (Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things). I believed this film should be shown to everyone, simply because we live in a generation of luxury and lots of wants. This film was simply an eye-opener for myself due to the fact that I, too, play a role in buying too much then ending up having too much and not having enough space to put these things. Recently, this Summer, I have realized that having three rooms in my house filled with just my clothes, is unhealthy for myself and, in this case, even the world. I, too, have never seen this film before but have heard of the idea of minimalism and now understand the importance behind the idea. From person experience, I simply agree with the sad truth that we find warmth and happiness in materialistic things at first, but get tired of them after a certain amount of time. The inspiration that minimalist showcase and depict in the film is crucial and massive. This film really makes you realize that half the stuff you own just continues to collect dust due to the fact that you lost interest in it after so long. After watching this film and understanding from Ken’s previous lecture on decreasing your carbon footprint will help me immensely in helping the environment and making smarter decisions for myself when purchasing things and understanding whether or not it is a necessity or a simple want that will just take up space rather than serve a purpose.

After watching the film and reading you’re comment, I totally agree with everything you stated. You couldn't have said it any better. Nowadays, like you said,  no matter how many things we buy, we are never happy. Our generations have been raised to always want more and replace anything and everything we have with new. We can have cars that work perfectly, but eventually we get tired of them and then decide to get into huge debt and get a new one. It clearly isn't necessary, but we do it anyways because we get this "feeling" of owning something new. 
<br><br>
Because we live in "civilized" homes and not "savage" homes, we always have extra spaces in which we feel the need to occupy with something. It isn't necessary to have 30 pairs of shoes or 40 pairs of jeans. There are many humans around the globe that own one pair of shoes and are completely content with themselves. This is truly inspiring, but sad at the same time that we can't be like them. They should be the example for the world. Because of our selfish behavior, they will suffer from this climate crisis because of populations like ours which is disgusting.

I found the film "Minimalism" to be very eye-opening as well. I felt that there is always the thought in the back of most people, "How would life be different without...?" I have commonly had this conversation with myself and friends and family but never truly taken upon action in being more conscious of my role as a consumer in our society. However, I felt that the film demonstrated and exemplified how viable minimalistic lifestyles are and not some foreign idea or dream for a future that our society can never attain. We have showered ourselves in excess and failed to realize the waste of materials and consequences of our actions because we are surrounded in a world that is only aiming for more and more. I feel that if there is more discussion and consideration by all about the true nature of our way of living in a first world economy, there would be greater individuals realizing that we have gone far beyond than just living with basic necessities. We have made necessities be accompanied with luxury, and this association has created a mindset that we deserve an extra spend or a treat for ourselves. I have practiced this view many times but after viewing the film I realize that this "extra buy" adds up and sometimes I have multiple new things, showing that what we may see as a deserving treat for ourselves has turned into a routine habit as a consumer. I really enjoyed the film as it made me reflect how I play as a consumer among millions of others with similar habits.
<br><Br><hr><br>

I agree, I really enjoyed this fail because it drew my attention to how crazy it is that humans just want more things. And brought up the question: Why? Before watching it, I was just thinking of the "minimalist" aesthetic, which has gotten very popular (white walls, not a lot of furniture, a few plants) but I am now viewing this in the way that is much more holistic, as a lifestyle. I think that it takes, at least for me, a conscious effort to not pray victim to the cycle of getting something new and making that thing my favorite solely because of its novelty, and once it is no longer new, longing for something else to take its' place. Thinking about this paradox, in addition to the widespread effects that consumer culture has on the rest of the world, come to gather to answer the question why in a surprising way for me: For no good reason. This film has definitely made me look at my own life and at the choices that I make every day and ask myself why.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I agree; this film was very eye opening. It really made me contemplate my own life and think about what I actually need in my life. Was it a lot less than I expected it to be? I just knew that it was very strange for me to think that everything I ever strived for was actually pointless in the end. I buy these clothes for what purpose? I probably won't even end up using 10% of it, so what's the point in me getting it. I could fill my closet with plain black t-shirts and I would still be able to live. Like you said, it's strange to think about how humans are wired to progress. When mixed with the societal view that more is better or that more expensive equals better quality, humans keep on consuming. Consumerism is so toxic, especially in the US. People just keep on buying, which I guess is a way for them to compete. But why should we compete when we can all live such a simple and joyful life? In America, happiness is measured by the quantity of our money or the quantity in which we consume material items. To us, it seems that everything is disposable. Or in other words, we'll move on to the next item in time. I'm guilty of this consumerism myself. I buy new clothes or random objects that I think look cool or that I think that I'll need, but I'll end up never using those exact items, making it a waste of my money and a waste of something that could've been important to me. While I agree that it'd be hard to switch to minimalism, I think it'd be the best for all of mankind, and honestly it would be easier for all of us in general!
<br><Br><hr><br>
I agree with how materialism really affects us psychologically. Financial status plays a big role in today’s society. The more money you have the happier you are. This is not the case.  People think having the new, experience, and flashy things make you look “cooler” when in reality there’s no real need for all of these things. We’ve been conditioned that the higher you are on the socioeconomic pyramid, the happier you are. That you need new stuff to be happy. Minimalism really is the way to go. I myself am guilty of buying things because it makes me feel good but in reality I don’t have a lot of belongings. Coming from a middle class family it seems being a minimalist isn’t out of reach. Those who are more fortunate and higher up on the pyramid will likely see this as an issue because they want to enjoy the fruit of their labor. It’ll be difficult to get everyone onboard but it may be possible if people are willing to give up impulsive spending and use what they have.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I like how this comment puts it, because just like her I have heard about minimalism, but never fully understood it until I watched this movie. I’m so grateful for this class because I never would have watched or even found this movie without it. I’ve read articles about celebrities living minimalistic lifestyles, like Daniel Norris, but never understood why or how people do it. This really made me question my lifestyle and made me think of how wasteful the consumerism lifestyle is. Fast fashion, especially is horrible for the environemnt and after watching this I now realize how many added benefits minimalism provides for both the consumer and the environment. Losing all the objects we prize so high in our lives would really suck at first, yet would make us so happy in the end. Just like the people telling their story, we would hopefully adjust into that lifestyle just as well and be in a better state of mind. Literally everybody has too much stuff, and if they stopped buying stuff it would be much better for the limited resources we have on planet earth. By not using disposable plastic products in our lifestyles, we could create a much healthier earth and reduce the use of these harmful plastics significantly. Educating the masses is a hugely significant way to raise awareness of how this lifestyle could easily be adopted and create a huge benefit for planet earth.
<br><Br><hr><br>
You hit the nail right on the head with this comment. I definitely resonate with your comment in the sense of how consumerism is such a fundamental component of our lifestyle. It is all around us, whether it be our laptops or phones or shoes or even water bottles. We always want more. The new iPhone is coming out? "I definitely need it because my old phone has the old color". Why is this even within our realm of thoughts when there is so much that could be done with the money we would be excessively spending on products giving us temporary utility before going out to excessively spending again on products. It's such a silly perpetual cycle. Yet so many of us are caught right in the center of it. Minimalism does a great job in displaying this prominent cycle in which we have all found ourselves in. More specifically, the documentary addresses the question of when will we ever be satisfied? I personally think that humans aren't biologically programmed to be dissatisfied but rather social norms have embodied that role. If it wasn't for the constant social media comparison, the large influence of pop culture and just the objective state of socially comparing yourself, we would all be so happy. Seeing documentaries like Minimalism really aid in stopping you from wanting more but rather appreciating what you have and in fact driving you to own less.
<br><Br><hr><br>

I thoroughly agree with your comment, and I agree with the idea that "humankind cannot help but constantly" want more stuff. We are a society that thrives on following the latest trends in order to "fit in." We don't realize how negatively impactful our actions can be until it is too late.
<br><Br><hr><br>

I totally agree. There are so many things I own that I never use, but tell myself that I need still. The consumer culture is very difficult to get away from. We are bombarded with ads everywhere trying to convince us that we need certain products. It is important that we as a society move away from this idea of wanting more and more because there are not unlimited resources on this planet and we are causing a lot of environmental damage.
<br><br><hr><br>
Same as you, I’m really enjoy with the film too. Watching this “Minimalism” makes me realize that the minimalism I heard and liked before is only a way of expressive art but not actual minimalist actions. Though I would say I’m a supporter of minimalism, I’ve never successfully done the first step or even determined to do so. I can’t stop the desire of purchasing new stuff and can’t get rid of the list driven by materialism. I’m not sure whether people are the same as me. What I’m sure is, just like Ken mentioned in the video, the idea of minimalism is not applied to general public as a whole and thus not applied to a large extent. I would say that probably more propaganda of this idea could help. The most significant mean and core for a larger application is to let people believe in their heart that minimalism is the base and origin of further development, and make people truly like it.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I had very similar feelings watching the documentary. In regards to my own carbon footprint, I often struggle with trying to correct my own bad consumer habits. I'm not going to lie, I enjoy shopping and I care about fashion, but I often feel a sense of guilt for these habits, as I realize consumption is killing the planet and because I need to get away from the idea that happiness is in material things. This film helped me bring some of my behaviors into question and really forced me to examine them. But, I do believe there are ways to still enjoy things I like while also being environmentally sustainable because I honestly don't think it is realistic to expect people in a society that places material goods and money as the epitome of success to just suddenly stop caring about those things. For example, when I shop, I can go thrift shopping instead of supporting fast fashion companies and other harmful brands. I also frequently try to clean out my things and either donate them or sell them at thrift stores. 
<br><Br>
Nonetheless, the film certainly made me think about the other ways in which happiness and success can be obtained, without such an emphasis on consumption. For example, your relationships with the people around you can be a great source of happiness when you focus on making them good. I also think happiness can be found in having a sense of purpose, such as being committed to being the Earth more habitable for us and future generations.

The part of the comment when you mentioned the desire to fill the empty space in our house is really true. However, at a certain point even after we’ve filled the space with “Stuff” we never even go to the room. It was really eye-opening to hear that 40% of the space in our houses usually goes unused. The craziest part is that it is absolutely true even from just my own personal experience. My family has lived in the same house for the 7 or 8 years and we have only used our dining room a handful of times. That's not to say it is a complete waste of money to have one for special occasions (same goes for a guest bedroom) but when we are talking about dining rooms that are massive and highly decorated but probably get used once or twice a year...that is just a gross misuse of space. And to your point about finding stuff in your closet that you didn’t even realize you had, I had a similar realization when I was packing for college this past summer. After years of impulsively buying random things that I didn’t need, I realized that a ton of the stuff I own is completely unnecessary. Similar to the reasoning behind a carbon tax, I think this idea of minimalism is actually very likely to genuinely lead to change because it is not only environmentally but also fiscally beneficial. I really was persuaded by the segment where it is mentioned that people with a $500,000 look and see what $500,000 can buy instead of thinking what do “I” need. Thinking in this manner can help people live more responsibly and sustainably so its kind of hitting two birds with one stone.

Quite frankly, it's not all your fault for constantly desiring new things. Unfortunately, it's the media provoking this unhealthy mindset which this film did a great job referring and admitting to. The saddest part about the media's coverage, is that it reaches across the globe. No matter where you are from geographically, or what type of household/income you've grown up in, you will always want what you see other people praise or brag about. It's so sad to think how many people are brainwashed by something so stupid like social media. Many can be so happy living a minimalist life but they just don't know it because they are so deeply convinced that they need to keep purchasing to keep a reputation or a status which eventually will fade either way and won't matter in a few years from now. A minimalist life would surely promote a healthier mental state as well.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I also watched Minimalism and really enjoyed the story of Ryan and Josh and the minimalists organization. I find that it is really easy to learn from their story because they both had the stereotypical finance and corporate jobs that made lots of money but Ryan still was not happy. But now they both committed to being minimalists and go around telling their story to any and all audiences no matter how small. One line in particular was when they were already talking to a small crowd but then talked about the time they had a talk and only two people showed up. The fact that they are still happy to go around sharing their message no matter what the turn out shows they truly want to start a change. One thing that seems to be the issue with minimalism is that not everyone will believe in the minimalist message because they are hearing it from people who have had more than them so they think they will be happy with more. Even when studies have shown that happiness plateaus after one's salary reaches $70,000, people seem to usually have to have the bigger house and nice things originally, then downsize to appreciate minimalism like the woman in the film. The ideal goal is for people to accept tiny house or at least smaller houses and have that be the first house they work towards. The explanation of how people usually look for the house based on their money and not based on their needs seems very common and is what I think of the biggest misconceptions people need to learn about.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I agree with you! I personally don't think I can achieve the goal of being a minimalist because I usually can't help myself shopping and purchasing what I like. However, I realized how bad this lifestyle is because it created too many unnecessary wastes for me unconsciously. Every month I checked my bank transactions I just wonder where all my money went, now I guess I found the answer. Shopping is one of the things I really enjoy to do since it somehow can reduce my pressure, but I was wrong. The more frequently I shop, the more unnecessary things I would get. Many of the things I got maybe only used once by me and then got thrown into a corner in my room.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I definitely agree with your sentiment. Way too many people equate happiness to the likes of materialism, or some form of it, as if it can compensate for more enriching experiences in life that can give you true happiness. Buying new things can certainly bring you short-term happiness- I feel a rush of happiness and satisfaction when I wear my favorite pair of jeans, or use my handy wireless headphones, or when I take a drink from a high-quality reusable water bottle. But I don't NEED these things, and my happiness with them won't last forever. Humans, in reality, need very few things to survive and maintain happiness. Society teaches us that you always need more to be happy. More food, more clothes, more makeup, more money, nicer homes and cars, etc, but we never actually need it. We have all been brought up in a consumer-heavy cultural atmosphere, and with how much social media permeates our thought-processes and perceptions of what life should be like, it only adds fuel to the materialistic fire. 
<br><br>
I really admire people who take it upon themselves to evaluate literally everything that they own and utilize in their daily lives and decide whether or not a specific item is truly necessary for their way of living. It makes me think of the times when I would watch HGTV with my mom at home, and there would be episodes of Tiny Living playing, and that's REALLY some minimalism. These people live fulfilled and happy lives with just the bare minimum, and I hope that I can learn to be critical enough with myself to decipher my true necessities in life.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I am totally feeling the same when you state your perspective. I am also really enjoyed the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things. It just shows me that life can still be 100 percent perfect without too much decoration. I still remember the first day I move into a new loft for myself. I video chat my mom to let he see around the room. With the empty space, she recommends me to buy as less as I can. Not only because I won’t live to much long in this new place, but also it will cost too much to buy that new furniture. My mom said, as a sophomore, except your brain and your computer, anything is all decoration. Buy a mattress and sleep will be enough for you. I was very mad at that time because most of the Chinese parents will give their child a lot of money to but the furniture they want to buy. So I still buy a table, two chairs and a bean bag except the “basic need” mattress. Though I feel I still need to but something because my other friends who live in Silverwood also bought sofa, TV and projector……
<br><Br>
However, as time flies. Today is the 5th months I live in here. My furniture is still enough for me to use. I adapt the living mood as Minimalism” I do not need a TV nor projector because I have a computer. I do not need a sofa because I have my bean bag. I love the convenient and simple lifestyle I have. It is not only cheap but also convenient for the whole time.
 <br><br>
 Thanks for my mom's advice and thanks engl 23

I also heard of the idea of Minimalism before, but never knew much about it until after watching the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things.” The film made me reevaluate what I considered to be important in life. I was appalled by how determined and violent people can become to obtain a specific item that they want, especially during sales. It goes to show that many humans are dependent on the consumption culture. On the other hand, I was delightfully surprised to see that there are people who live a life without depending on an abundance of items for happiness. 
<br><br>
I am intrigued by the minimalist lifestyle because I realized how much money I waste on items that I do not need. By living the minimalist lifestyle, not only will I become more conscious with my spending, I will also become less materialistic. I also had the same realization that there are multiple items that I forgot that I even own deep in my closet. Although the minimal lifestyle will be a difficult transition for me because I am used to buying items (specifically clothes) without much thought, I believe that it is a good decision for myself and especially the environment as it discourages fast fashion.
<br><br><Hr><br>
This comment was very interesting to me. I realize that many people are able to have very few things and be extremely happy with how they are living their lives with few possessions. But as I write this comment Im looking around the room that I share with my roommate. Every surface is covered with things, from pencils to knick-knacks to textbooks. And likewise, every single wall is almost completely covered. I have two tapestries in my room covering a lot of the wall space, there are dozens of printed pictures taped to the wall and on the bed, I have at least 4 throw pillows as does my roommate. 
<br><Br>
As I look around it has become very apparent to me how empty and depressing my room would be without all of my possessions and all of my pictures. This is interesting. I realize that I am associating my possessions with happiness. This is the biggest flaw for me and the world. Posessions=Happiness, that is not how it should be, but commercialism has gotten so bad. I have grown up with commercialism and now all of these things make me happy. This is not how it is supposed to be.
<br><Br>
If the would and humanity would value minimalism more than maybe we would be happier as a whole, and maybe the earth would be better off without people's insane consumerism.
<br><br><Hr><br>

Likewise, I enjoyed Minimalism as a film for many reasons that also pertain to self-connection to the subject matter. I refer to this a lot, but it is true that Marie Kondo has made a huge impact on my perspective of life and decluttering, and Minimalism was a heavy reflection on that aspect as well. Kondo’s life motto and message surrounds the concept of keeping only the things in life that sparks joy- but this is much easier said than done. Like you, many people including myself cannot help but constantly want more things. You summarize it into short words great that no matter how much we buy, we are never satisfied, and it does not make us happy necessarily. I like that you are able to take away from this film to make smarter choices for the world while helping you get rid of things, because that is exactly how this film edged me to think as well. There are so many people out there that do not publicize their happiness found in minimal things, and rather, media portrays the heavy emphasis on owning more and expensive things as the thing to be envious of. In reality, especially as I am older, I have even unconsciously felt happier with less. The best example of this is holidays like Christmas and Halloween, where before when I was younger, I would want lots of presents and lots of candy. Now, I am happy with one thing, or nothing at all to be honest. Like you, as I got older, I am able to decide what is a waste of space and what I really want and need. It is a step towards growth, but also, as things have accumulated since I was born, it is now time to look back on keepsakes, and part ways with some of them, even if it is hard. My biggest challenge, as for many alike, will be cutting down our consumerism and ridding of waste, but as emphasized in this film, Minimalism shows the potential happiness and future we can and will be able to find in a toned down, emptied out, and purer lifestyle that both benefits a healthy mind and a healthy planet.

I like your last statement and I think it has quite a bit of value behind it. It's very true that people buy the new things just because they are new. The best example I can come up with are people that rebuy a new pair of Air Force 1 (all white pair of shoes) every time their current own pair gets dirty, not because the shoe is worth out or that you grew out the shoe size, but because of society's influence, we feel the need to get these items. We can be influence very easily into buying products or items b tased on the inert stature value that they might bring to our lives. This may come in the form of invasive ads that personally attack and ridicule those that don't have the newest and best up to date items on the market. I find it interesting how people are quick to blame the individual for being greedy and materialistic when in truth, the system the formed them should be at fault, and I believe that this idea is slowly starting the manifest itself particularly well in todays young generation. I know quite a few people that don't want all of the extravagant luxuries that come from wealth, but likewise I still know those who would still want the big house and lots of cars when they're older, no matter the effect it has on the environment. I believe shifting the idea that materialism equates to happiness to that in finding what in life doing brings joy to your own life. While I'm not saying to live in cardboard box, people just need to rationalize the purchase they make by questioning "why do I want this? Will it make me happy because of what it provides or the fact that I just own it?". I feel this is just one question to start of with when deciding the value of something.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I really liked this comment! I enjoyed how you took the approach of saying that we "constantly want more stuff" couldn't agree more. Minimalism is a great concept, especially considering the world we live in today. People's constant need for more has fostered a poor relationship with the earth/nature. Things simply do not increase happiness. If you have more then what is necessary, you indeed have a luxury! Luxuries are not needed and they don't do much when related to happiness levels. I really thought then part where the miniature condo was introduced was spectacular. It was insane to me what you could do with virtually one big room, you can turn it into a multi-functional home. This movie most definitely inspired/inspires me to get rid of things I don't need. Seeing films like this and taking this course is a constant reminder that materialistic items don't mean much. I am glad to say my mindset is shifting and its shifting for the better.
<br><br><Hr><br>

Your comment totally resonates with me. I have a really big problem with how many clothes I have and recently stopped buying new ones so that I could get rid of all the clothes I don't need/use (which is about 60%). I too have items in my closet that haven't seen the light of day in years but won't get rid of because I have a weird attachment to them. Lately, I've realized that I buy a lot of things because I think it will make me happy but like in the film, it just stresses me out and puts my thoughts where they don't need to be. 
<br><br>
I've wanted to try minimalism for quite a while now and this film came at just the right time. My roommate and I have actually been talking about giving away some of our stuff because it takes up so much space and takes up time we could be spending studying or doing homework. All we want to do is help out the planet. I think this is a really good mindset to have and a good way to do your part not only for the planet but for the close relationships and self worth we should be more focused on. The spaces we fill in our lives should be with experiences or love, not bad materialistic tendencies or consumerism. My response to Ken's last comment in the video is that we should make minimalism as trendy as thrifting or going vegan, with positive connotations comes curious people who want to know more about how to change for the better.
<br><br><Hr><br>

I agree with you and I can also relate to how me growing up made me realize that true happiness doesn't come from materialistic things. I have become more aware about how companies basically brainwash people to just think that what they are selling will make make you more "popular" or "happier." Who are they to tell us what makes us happy? I like to think about what makes me happy and try not to think about the things I want but rather need. I really think about my family and their love, I also think a lot about my girlfriend and how her company makes me happier than any stupid materialistic thing.

    I liked that they explained that “stuff” fills this void that we humans have and leads to an addiction. That’s why lottery winners become miserable. Instagram makes me feel poor sometimes for not being as stylish and fresh as the people featured are. I always thought brands were ugly actually and I’m sure many would agree but its all about status now. Does minimalism apply to temporary objects? Like beer? Marijuana? Or just those things that bring clutter and hoarding about?
<br><br>

This video reminds me of my 12 people that I live with back home. We are a big family, so you’d assume we have countless of objects and possessions; however, we all frequently donate and sell our things once we are done rather than toss them. My room back home is also extremely small so microapartment living isn’t foreign to me. What about college? Does dropping out and having less debt and having more time to change the world an aspect of minimalism?
<br><br>


Nowadays, for Christmas or birthday, I’ll ask for things I actually need like toothpaste and shampoo because these things keep me from going out in the first place. This video inspired me. Full time traveling would be a dream as long as I can sustain myself. I know someone’s gotta put in the work and keep the flow going and I’m not suggesteing I void myself of this, but instead i see it as a means of getting enough money that allows me to live happily and spread the importance of minimalism and change to others.

The concept of minimalism is wonderful and necessary in my opinion, however it is also a challenging one with the manner in which the systems in the United States are placed. The truth of the matter is that the architects, entrepreneurs, scientists, businessmen, and such are privileged to be able to minimize their living but with the optimal situation at hand. This is a privilege the majority of the citizenry in many countries even developed ones do not have because they are made to live cheap “large” lives. For example, anything that is better for us in nutrition and living is made more expensive than the bulk of largeness that you can get for cheaper. I am sometimes disappointed but not surprised by the neo-liberal agenda pushed forward that has good intent but do not check their privilege.

In Visualizing a Plenitude Economy, an idealistic model of economic reformation that is both beneficial for the environment and more financial stability of people is outlined. I feel confident and sense an optimistic outlook in the adoption of this system, but I think the investment to achieve the delicate balance of abundance will be time consuming, as this entails there being a project for humanity that must be attended to and built from the ground up. The time that it would take to fully reach this state can be placed to other solutions that can produce results at a much faster rate and with the same foundation of sustainability. The High Price of Materialism provides a sociological perspective on the effects of materialism on the values treasured by society. Standard of living is suggested to be a problematic issue because of the amount of stuff that would be involved in reaching a certain degree that can be deemed appreciable. I do agree that a switch in the way we approach the structure of our lifestyles and reconsidering what is necessary for us would help us treasure the values we have set for ourselves and be more conscious and mindful of our planet and how much it already provides us.
</p><hr>
<p>
I like the idea conveyed by the film: “Life is better with less”. People nowadays are too into the material life. We buy the things we don’t need, and it take us a lot of time taking care of them. We need to focus more on our inner world other than the outer. By only getting the basic need and desire, our life would more simple. It’s not getting rid all our stuff and starting a complete plain life, which is too extreme. In the other aspect though, for the poor, they still need to deal with their living, so this idea does not really apply to them.
</p><hr>
<p>
The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About Important Things” was a very interesting film and really hit home for me and I’m sure for everyone else who may feel personally attacked about the way we live our consumerist lifestyles. Even though the film was not meant to come from an environmentalist perspective, I agree that the idea of minimalism aligns with the ideals of environmentalism. Waste is such a huge problem in our world, our landfills are quickly filling up and many of the products that we all enjoy don’t have more sustainable alternatives. By the time we advance technology to make those products sustainable, it will be too late. But what’s something we can do right at this instant? Change our habits, our perspectives, and our lifestyle approach to materialism. 
<br><br>
It’s unfortunate that not many people have questioned why we work and work just to afford items that give us instant gratification. Especially considering the fact that when we invest our time in more fruitful experiences that we enjoy, it provides us a more delayed gratification that lasts a lot longer. I believe that minimalism would be a difficult, but also very effective message to promote to people in order to combat the climate crisis. This is due to the fact that minimalism not only benefits a cause that people feel out of touch with, but it also hits home for them personally because it will immediately affect their own happiness.

After watching Minimalism last quarter, I found it very eye-opening, as it put into perspective how often I say I “need to buy” something without truly needing it. Overconsumption is a huge problem in our culture, but i never considered myself to be part of the problem. The film explains how the more we have, the more we want, yet we remain unhappy. All day long we are faced with advertisements of every kind encouraging us to buy more things in order to live up to the latest expectations. Everyday there's something new we “need to have,” but minimalism challenges the notion that we need excessive possessions in order to be satisfied. Our greed often blinds us from seeing the value in the things we have. When we learn to be grateful for the necessary things we possess, then we will truly be happy. “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” explained how we can create where we work less hour weeks and become happier as a society. While I do think it sounds like a great idea, I don’t think it’ll work. I think people work the most hours possible because of how high the cost of living is, combined with overconsumption. People feel the need to work more to afford the life they want to live. I think it’s important for people to learn more about materialism so they can see how much of their income they spend on unnecessary things. “The High Price of Materialism” exposes how all these things we buy make us unhappy. We buy so many things because we convince ourselves “we deserve it,” and “worked hard for it,” but at the end of the day,  all the work we put into buying random things only gives us temporary happiness. I think even if people learn this, it won’t be easy to make a big change overnight.

Recently I lost my AirPods, and it made me really upset to have to use wired headphones again. Besides being broke, what’s been holding me back from buying new ones is reminding myself of this film. I know I don’t need AirPods. Wired earphones do the exact same thing. However I now know the convenience of AirPods. No wires to get tangled. My music pauses when I take one out. I can walk away from my phone and still listen to music. I know it’s completely materialistic of me, and I don’t want to waste my money, but to be candid as soon as I have money, I’m buying AirPods.

Upon watching this film, I began to change my mindset of how I view material things. For me, personally, I have always loved shopping with my mom and my sister. It is a past time of ours that we enjoy doing because we are able to bond while spending time with each other while buying cute things. However, it is true that half of these things we don't even end up wearing that often and they either end up in the back of our closet or at goodwill. The fact that Milburn and Nicodemus are working to spread the message that by letting go, we are opening ourselves up for more meaningful human interactions and saved money is inspirational to me. All of these people that are seeking meaning in life through simplicity shows that we do not need to buy expensive things in order to be happy. The clothes that we wear and the luxury cars that we drive mean nothing in the grand scheme of things - it is just a temporary satisfaction. This film was extremely inspiring for me to start thinking about ways that I can change my lifestyle and make it more simple. By pursuing this idea of minimalism, not only are we doing good things for the environment but also we are doing good things for ourselves.

1) Was the film effective at communicating it subject? If so, how did it achieve this?
From my opinion, this film effectively describes its topic by directly introducing its theory about the concept of minimalist and how minimalists begin to realize that they need to change their way of living. The film persuades people to live in a minimal way by telling different people’s stories on various aspects of life.
<br><br>
2) Who do you think might be the film’s audience? People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers?
The film audiences might be common people that don’t know a brand new life style called Minimalism. The film shows examples of people who lived in miserably families and then became rich but somehow still didn't find the meaning of life, and eventually realized that happiness doesn't transfer through buying stuffs but through simplifying it. An additional instance would be reflected from fast-fashion industries, people tend to feel contained by buying clothes, and the sellers tend to use the social values of new trend clothes to attract buyers in advertisements. The last example would be a family with kids, which is a common type of family. They teach their kids values of saving the planet from their own actions, even though it is hard to simplify kids’ needs.
<br><br>
3) What was your general reaction to the film? Was your response primarily intellectual or emotional? In other words, how did the film make you feel? What did it cause you to think about? 4) Did you learn anything new from the film? If so, what? Did the film change your attitudes in anyway? If so, how? After watching it, did you feel optimistic or pessimistic?
I like the way how the director tries to explain how minimalists live- from day to day life and common family situations. Every benefit of being minimalists begins with a personal story,which wakes people’s sympathy,and then describes the changes by interviewing and videos in details to make sure people can visualize whether a minimalist life is what they want. And I feel so optimistic about it, since it really considers about the environment and reflects whether the daily actions of humans are right. However, I don’t think that everyone should choose this way to live necessarily, as freedom does exist.
</p><hr>
<p>
I keep my closet small and make sure to regularly donate my old clothes and belongings that I no longer use. I don’t see the point of holding onto old items just for the sake of it. I know I won’t use it again, and I rather have someone else benefitting from it. I know that I live a blessed life, and I appreciate all that I have, but I agree with one of the film’s main takeaways about adopting a minimalist lifestyle in order to help find freedom from our world’s consumer culture. A lot of people don’t have the choice of whether or not they want to live minimalist lives. I often think about that when buying something new because consumer culture is killing our planet. The worst part is that I know those who cannot afford an extra pair of shoes or an apple watch are suffering the most. I really enjoyed watching “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” because it opened my eyes even more. There is more to life than achieving The American Dream, and I think there are several other ways to make myself happy. I make sure to surround myself with good people and always appreciate what I have rather than want for things I don’t need.
</p><hr>
<p>
Though I already knew about and to a certain extent implement minimalism in my life, Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things was full of surprising facts and conclusions about human nature. Though counter-intuitive, there is a lot of truth to what they are saying: you can't buy your way to happiness, and attempting to do so will destroy you eventually. 
<br><br>
I was personally caught off guard by some of the things I learned in the documentary. For example, I was surprised to learn that we only use about 40% of the space in our houses, even though we want bigger houses. It struck me as a tremendous waste. I understand that big houses as an aspiration of The American Dream (tm), but I personally never understood why people would want them. Now knowing that most Americans don't even use the house space, I find big houses to be an even more bizarre phenomenon.  Another instance is the fact that we see around 5000 ads per day. That's INSANE. No wonder we're consumerist; we're constantly and uncritically barraged with messages that say we need more, different, trendy items.
<br><br>
This is on a more personal note, but I am a more socially-minded person. Some of the individualist and anecdotal segments made me wonder how we as the viewers would be expected to do that, and that pulled me out of my imagination and the future they were attempting to get me to envision. Though I like minimalism, it struck me that the social problems that they only addressed briefly were actually way more important. What does it matter that you buy less if corporations are still manufacturing more? I don’t expect every documentary to fully address every issue that affects the situation they’re trying to bring to our attention (we’d be there for hours) but the intensely individualistic nature of the documentary rankled me when I considered the incredibly social nature of the issues they mentioned, like our collective lack of happiness and connection, climate change, fast fashion, economic problems, etc, though I’ll admit to liking their addressing of the materialist culture.
<br><br>
Overall, I would rate this  7/10 and would recommend it, with the caveat that many of the people featured have a lot of privilege to be able to up and leave their jobs, move their lives without long-term repercussion. Not to invalidate the things they were struggling with, but the way they described implementing minimalism into their lives was untenable to me.

I am not in any way a wealthy person, and neither is my family; however, after watching the film "Minimalism", I found myself amazed at how much stuff I have. Even as someone who grew up well below the poverty line, I still have so much junk. I have knick-knacks lying in my closet, photos and pictures I never plan on hanging, clothes I don't wear, books that haven't been opened, etc, etc. Its as if the aspect of just HAVING the items brings me fulfillment, or at least it briefly feels like it does. I wish I could compile just how much money, and materials I have wasted by buying things I will never use. Even with all of this junk, It amazes me even further to think what it must feel like to be wealthy and have even more. This film forced a reflection of "how much stuff do I really need?" and furthermore, "how much of this stuff will I never use".
</p><hr>
<p>
I am surprised I have never heard as such a thing as interesting as minimalism before. Quite the notion explaining that we do not need as much stuff as we have. It may seem like it, long life memories or just artifacts in which we cannot let go. There must be a time to let go and with minimalism that time is now. I love how they brought up the idea of consumerism and the fact that we are buying way more than we can afford and actually need in the long run. We need to realize that we just need to buy what we actually need and what we can afford. The minimalists explain that in order to be happy we need to get rid of all our “stuff” and just let go of what we think we need in our lives. They just need to forget about what they think they need, all of them seemed to be enjoying life with what they had. They already know that many people do not support it but keep on doing it anyway. However they need to realize that lifestyle is not very realistic to some people and just know people will not transition so lightly. But it is an amazing way of reducing your carbon footprint in the long run with all the space you actually save.

<p>
When I first watched Minimalism, a few minutes in, I remember thinking that I couldn’t live a minimalist lifestyle. By the end of the film, my thoughts changes pretty drastically. I found myself relating to the Minimalists and some of the people they talked to. I don’t enjoy spending money on things that I do not need or won’t use, so I already don’t consume very much. When they talked to the former Wallstreet broker, I thought his story about how he chose quitting his job over taking the promotion he was offered that would give him a six figure salary and a corner office. He looked at his life and decided that he was not going to be happy in the position he used to dream of getting to. I think him walking away had to be a terrifying decision, especially since it was something he had been working towards for a long time. 
<br><br>
The way that the Minimalists perceive minimalism, or at least how they describe it in the film, is more appealing than what people may have previously thought minimalism was. They look at it as getting rid of things that do not add value to your life to help improve the quality of your life. Their logic makes sense because the less stuff you have that you don’t necessarily need or like, the less stress you will have since you won’t have to worry about it. 
<br><br>
I really like the idea of reforming our economy and society in a way that will be beneficial to both the planet and people. Not having to work as long as people with full time jobs do now would be great! Both of my parents leave the house for work at 7 AM and usually do not get home until 6:30-7 PM every weekday and still go into work on most weekends. If working hours were shorter, it would greatly improve national mental health averages and give people time to relax, spend time with family, and take up hobbies.
</p><hr>
<p>
"Minimalism" brought up a way of life that I would have never known about or thought anything of if it were not for this video. there were two sections of the video that I found to be the most interesting. First, the section of that first struck my attention was that people choose to live in "tiny houses". I thought at first that these homes were small attachments on a normal house. After watching further in the video however, living in one of those homes seems so much more realistic and appropriate. So many people are currently living in homes in which they haves room that they do not even use on a day to day basis. The tiny house takes this problem away, and instead allows you to gain the full utility of your residence. It would also be much easier to clean and maintain. 
<br><br>
The second part of the video that I found interesting was the 333 clothing idea. By reducing your clothing down to 33 items you would save a lot of time and money on clothing. It may seem unrealistic to own such a small amount of clothing, especially in todays fast fashion industry, but if more people were to start doing this then I am positive more people would ditch the notion of fast fashion. If people were to start implementing 333 and more people were to live in tiny homes i believe this could make a huge impact on people starting to take serious action in regard to the climate crisis.
</p><hr>
<p>
After watched this film, I found out that I just wasted too much money on many unnecessary things. Owning many stuffs is also a way to waste the space. Take me for example, I love buying clothes that I have a lot of clothes that I have no chance to wear. I think I do not need so many clothes which I waste too much money and spaces to place these stuffs.
</p><hr>
<p>
Minimalism is a documentary which introduced an idea that I believe is profound. The film is really effective at communicating its subject by following probably the two most famous minimalists—Josh and Ryan. They raised the idea of minimalism, wrote books about it and spread out the idea through their speeches. The film also interviewed many people who gave up what they had before they accept the idea of minimalism to show how much their lives have been changed because they had “less”. 
<br><br>
As for me, my general reaction to the film is not surprised but very reflective about my personal life. The issue of “having too much” in this film is very obvious for many people, but they never tried to seek a way to change it. This film gave a great example of an alternative lifestyle we can choose.
<br><br>
I learned a lot from this film; minimalism is a completely new concept for me. I always believe that buying and having more means happiness because we have a lot, but I didn’t realize the troubles it could bring—being messy, wasting stuff, etc. It did change my attitude that I will think carefully for my consumption next time. I don’t need to buy everything but the ones I really like. In general, I feel pretty optimistic for what this film is trying to teach us.
</p><hr>
<p>
In a lifestyle that has become rife with materialistic consumerism, it can become easy to be caught up with what you don’t have. Adopting a minimalist lifestyle can free you from the pressures of consumerism and outrageous flaunting of wealth. While downsizing alone can significantly lower your impact on the planet, making proper consumer choices also makes a great change. Using fabrics other than water-intensive cotton, going to local food markets, and reusing items are some very easy ways to start lowering your impact. The primary way for many to help with mitigating climate change is to become more carbon conscious and to acknowledge where our commodities come from.

Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things makes me understand why the less we have, the happier we are. When we have more, we tend to ignore what we already have and even can't live a normal life because of the interference. I quite understand that people always want more material possessions, because I am no exception. But we should learn to be content, after all, there are a lot of people in the world do not have enough food and clothes. Minimalism is a great way to live and we should promote it, especially it is good for the environment.
</p><hr>
<p>
I too have always enjoyed living minimalistic. I’ve always hated shopping. At this point my family doesn’t even bother asking if I want to come. Almost every large piece of clothing that I own has been handed down, thrifted, or gifted from my cousin
who worked for Brixton. Aside from my phone and headphones, I think I can
confidently say that I don’t have many attachments to material things. However,
there are still a lot of things that I don’t necessarily need. Instead of being
enticed by new clothing, toys, or video games, my biggest weakness in the
advertisement world are new food releases compared to anything else. But it’s
not hard to see how other people can become so obsessed with brand names, big
cars, and lavish houses. These things emulate an individual’s wealth and thus
their status in life, despite potentially acting as a façade for their true personalities
or feelings. Society is good at making us feel like we must impress others or maintain some certain image. I understand how important first impressions are and I’m not saying that hygiene and dressing well are not important, but apps like Snapchat
and Instagram can foster social pressures that set unreasonable expectations
for everyone. I liked the statement that minimalism teaches modesty, and that it’s
not necessary but can show that we don’t need everything to live. It can serve
as a tool that can assist you in finding freedom in a world where we are constantly
comparing ourselves and judging others.

After watching the film minimalism I now realize how easy it is to change my own lifestyle to one of a minimalist.  I think because the film showed many minimalists and how similar they are to someone who consumes more, it was easier to see myself in their situation. I think we have all become too used to seeing advertisements wherever we go and that definitely has an immense effect on our shopping habits whether we realize it or not. We are all too caught up in the menial things of daily life and the film makes us take a step back and see how meaningless much of it really is. I think adopting a minimalist lifestyle would certainly help reduce carbon emissions, but the issue is convincing enough Americans to do so. In the film you can get a feeling that even the reporters don’t take them as seriously as they should, which is the underlying issue in the entire documentary.
</p><hr>
<p>
Mm. I'm not so sure I like the plenitude economy. The main reason why I don't like it so much is that I know that corporations are implementing the idea of assigning less hours across the United States - mostly to screw their workers out of benefits and the legal protections that workers should have. I'm worried that attempting to move to a plenitude economy without actually guaranteeing that people have a good quality of life is going to end up very very poorly for workers.

I remember watching the film "Minimalism" on Netflix a few years back when I became interested in self improvement and stoicism. Two things have become clear to me since then. The first is that minimalism is as much of a protest against consumerism as it is on climate change. And the second being that, this film portrays an extreme perspective of minimalism. If you are adamant about living an environmentally friendly lifestyle, then you must acknowledge that the steps towards combating climate change are lumped in with the idea of being an activist. For me, this was never an easy thing to do because I had my own prejudices about what an activists looked like that where simply unappealing to me. For example: the film "Minimalism" largely depicts minimalism as people who own an extremely low number of items, comparable to a homeless person, and then presents that lifestyle as "freeing". Now, keeping in mind that minimalism is a way to combat climate change and therefore a form of activism,  the idea of living with 1 pair of pants and three of the same colored shirts is rather unappealing and I would dare to say radical. But since watching this film, I learned that minimalism is not confined to a solid number of belongings, but to the idea of consuming only what is necessary. 
<br><br>
Growing up I never realized this but, my mom taught us to have a minimalist diet. To eat as much as you need rather than as much as you want. And in analyzing her perspective on dietary consumption, I realized that mass consumption and its opposite of minimalism is rooted in culture. My mom is from the Dominican Republic where most of the produce that is consumed is locally grown. Although being raised in a second world country, the belief of eating as much as you need, carried over with her to the states. Comparably, so much of American culture is focused on having material goods in abundance. In the simplest terms, minimalism as a lifestyle does not have to be associated with the extremedities that are depicted in this film. You can own 10 pairs of shoes and still consider yourself a minimalist if those shoes are truly necessary in your opinion.
</p><hr>
<p>
In my opinion, Minimalism is the way to go. The act of simply having less makes everything easier. Although I find it a good idea, to be truthful, I would be considered somewhat of a "hoarder" due to my need to keep things that are not important but I think could be important or simply worth something in the future. And that is the thing about it, people think that what they own could be worth something and they just buy and buy things. That is a way that consumerism works too. If we had less advertising, propaganda, or even nostalgia then buyers would simply buy less. Minimalism is not just the act of having less but the act of having only what is necessary to live. Even for  child to understand the basic concept of having less stuff to enhance a living lifestyle speaks for how adults should be thinking.
</p><hr>
<p>
Minimalism takes an interesting approach to human desire and need. It suggest that a way of life in which you use as little as you possibly can, leads to becoming truly happy and content. By neglecting basic human desire which drives our consumption we can, as a society, overcome the climate crisis. Minimalism, while it does help to prevent climate change, is not just about saving the climate but about finding happiness. According to the film materialistic things brings us less happiness and desire for more.  Living a minimalist lifestyle can actually bring about happiness in your life because instead of always wanting something more, you are content with your belongings. You wouldn’t need to worry about buying a new iPhone or clothes and would drastically cut your CO2 emission costs. Just by not buying clothes people could drastically help the climate crisis. Instead of buying a lot and throwing it out after it’s meaning has been used up, if we keep our things and buy little (IE:live the minimalist lifestyle) then there wouldn’t be a need for more because the meaning is all the more special. The less you have the more you will find value in life and your belongings. The statement “money can’t buy happiness” is a false statement in the way that it can give people a sense of happiness, however a more accurate statement would be money can’t buy true happiness because true happiness is unaltered by materialistic attachment.
</p><hr>

<p>
Minimalists are like the fashion Marie Kondo. Throughout the documentary, I imagined leaving the old stuff behind and wondering, "will this bring joy to my life?" The answer to many things in our lives is usually no. We live in a culture that encourages overconsumption. It's easy to accept this reality and feel obligated to follow it. However, as many have described in this documentary, people just need to see that there is a choice, there is an alternative to living in constant consumerism. The pursuit of a minimalist lifestyle offers many opportunities for choice and freedom. In a country where we live to work, we need to learn to work to live.
<br><br>
In watching this video, I did think about why we're watching it in this class on the climate crisis. I understand that a reduction in consumerism would lead to a massive reduction in production, transportation and other industrial activities, leading to a reduction in social pollution. Ending fast fashion, in particular, will reduce the amount of material we waste. But I don't remember environmentalism ever appearing in a documentary as a reason for minimalism. The film shows that environmental awareness has many other benefits besides helping our planet. An environmentally conscious lifestyle, including minimalism, can have a big impact on your personal happiness and mental health.
</p><hr>

<p>
I was very moved by the Minimalism film because it made me think about the greater population of the world that doesn’t even have enough possessions for them to think to get rid of anything. However, here in America we are trying to find trendy enticing ways to get rid of our unnecessary items and live simply. It is an easy concept but hard to achieve without the desire to. It truly is a cultural thing to amass tons of stuff and hoard--we even have television shows just on hoarding how crazy. 
<br><br>
What I resonated most with was Shor’s suggestion that in order for this concept to work we need a larger institutional change so that everyone buys in. I bet if people were promised three days off a week they could manage being more minimalistic and spend their off time investing in sustainable activities like gardening or other projects--or even family time! The more the better for a lot of families and if three day weekends were real that could be a game changer.
<br><br>
Can enough people do this to make an impact? Maybe. I think the odds are highest if a large institutional change is made like Schor suggests.

<p>
The documentary, Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things, is about the important things were very effective at communicating its subject because it is a movie about two men that practice what they preach. 
<br><br>
This film introduces how easy and fulfilling living a minimalist lifestyle can be by following two men that want to spread the idea of minimalist living while also showing examples of other people who follow minimalist ideals with either their house size or the number of clothes in their wardrobe. The documentary presents many of the examples given of people living minimalist lives positively reinforced the audience to pursue a minimalist lifestyle. By doing this, it communicated its ideas very well.  Additionally, this lifestyle could make a dramatic impact on the environment. More and more clothing and goods would be distracted from the landfill and from being produced in toxic ways. It is told us that a life with the bare necessities is more significant and benevolent towards the environment than a life of excess.
</p><hr>

<p>
I found the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" extremely impactful and would recommend it to anyone living an over consuming lifestyle. People aren't just adopting this lifestyle for environmental reasons but also to increase their sense of fulfilment and happiness in life. We follow the stories of multiple people who have converted to various degrees of a minimalist lifestyle. These individuals struggled with the same pressures that we all face in a consumer society like the compulsive need to fill the void with things and the expectation that money equates success and happiness. Industries have strategically planted ideas like this in our minds and continue to force the next new trends onto us in hope that we will continue to buy. The minimalists though argue that you don't need to unhappily work a job in hope of a six figure salary or fill your life with more junk to be happy. My favorite line from the film was the last line when one of the minimalists emphasized the importance of people and relationships over material goods and said, "Love people and use things, because the opposite never works". It's the overconsumption of the world that drives industries to continue to pollute the air with fossil fuels. If more of the western world took on this minimalist lifestyle the planet would benefit immensely
</p><hr>

<p>
"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" gave more of a cultural view on using only the things we need to rather than focusing on the environmental  benefits as much. The film focused on the stories of people practicing Minimalism and the reasons they did it. It seemed more often that they did it for societal and personal reasons rather than saving the planet. Throughout the film when they were on their book tour and were on news stations, the banter between the hosts gave an impression that they did not take them seriously even though they had a huge following. I get that the hosts are trying to bridge a gap between their guests and their audience but it came across as though they didn't want to really know what Minimalism was really about. I loved seeing them have so many fans at their talks because it meant that they were getting their word out and fighting against the corporations that have ingrained materialism into our society and into our heads. I kept thinking about the things that I had and if they were really necessary and thinking about all the living space that my home had but was not really necessary. It was an interesting look into society and how we are impacted by corporations and how that in turn makes it so hard for us to give things up to help fight climate change.
</p><hr>

<p>
"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was definitely the most impactful and interesting movie we have watched so far this quarter. It touched on environmentalism, but it also emphasized so many other points of life that get in the way of being entirely environmental. One of the key factors in the environmental crisis we face, but also one that we ignore, is that everything is interconnected. The climate crisis cannot be solved without also solving social and economic issues. In the film, the two men initially moved towards minimalism because they felt mentally unhealthy in their climb up the corporate ladder. Here we see two issues that interconnect with the environment: the American dream of creating success through economic gains, and the ignorance of mental health that comes with that American dream. By switching their values, not only do minimalists create a happier lifestyle but also positively impact the environment. One cannot be done without the other. When people think about being more environmentally conscious, they often think about sacrifices they may or may not be willing to make. And while minimalism does encourage major sacrifices, they ultimately are better for both their own lives and the world around them.

While I agree with the notion of interconnection and that defying consumerism can make people happier, we have to look at this documentary from an unbiased perspective. I agree wholeheartedly that the climate crisis cannot be solved unless we first address major social and economic issues. More specifically, the wealth disparity in the USA and other countries. A minimalist lifestyle may seem doable and even exciting for people like me who come from a stable income, we must consider this other perspectives. Many Americans are not 'climbing the corporate ladder' like the two men in the movie, they are struggling and working multiple jobs just to feed themselves. In order to make minimalism actually work, you have to buy expensive and well made goods so that they can last. These goods are really only available to middle and upper class people because of their high cost. Minimalism is a great idea for people like me and the majority of the students at this school to minimize their carbon footprint. However, until we fix the disparity of wealth in American it would be naive to consider it the end all be all solution.

Minimalism was definitely a fun film to watch, mostly because of the interesting narrative that the narrators choose to tell about how to counteract materialism in the world. Through the narration and encounters that the two men had, they conveyed the idea that minimalism was the only way to truly live happily. What's interesting about the pursuit for minimalism is that it doesn't have to spring from the notion of wanting to help the Earth; it can be exclusively personal reasons or even inspirational reasons. Being able to find peace in such a new life is more than just wanting to help the environment: it's wanting to help yourself. And the bright side is, even if going minimalistic doesn't solve all of your issues, at least it is better for the planet in the meantime. The film left me feeling more optimistic about the future since their whole point revolved around being able to live happily without harming the environment any further.

<p>
This movie is so far one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. The concept and action of minimalism are just so interesting and fun to me. I would always have a try if there is really a chance for me to have a small house or room for me just like the ones in the movie. However, it is just too hard for all of us to start.
<br><br>
I believe it would also be super attractive for everybody else who shares the same age as me, a teenager. Who would not have wanted a secret base for just themselves? But the truth is, is it worth to live in such conditions in the long run. Psychologically, people are very adjustable. We always adjust the now situation and make that the normal condition. For example, I just bought a pair of shoes that I have always wanted, but a month later, I treat those shoes like every other pair I had. It is the same for our living conditions. It is the common characteristic or instinct, that was engraved on our DNA so that we can adjust the wilderness much faster than any other animal.

Second, if I do it, will everybody do it? If nobody follows, does it make my action lose its sense? Like I just said, I would definitely try the style of Minimalism if possible, but I will just TRY it. If I am going to live like a Chinese sage-like supreme human that lives in the forest and drinks morning dew for the entire of my life just trying to save the climate, I do not think I can persist, and I do not think that if I persist, my life will make any contribution. I am using a very extreme example, but I hope you would understand my point.

I think minimalism is important in so many ways. Having less makes it much easier to focus on the people around you, the environment and yourself. Americans have been trained to want and want and want and it is a never-ending cycle. It is a constant feeling of dissatisfaction. I find that feeling really scary. Putting your happiness into the hands of anything other than oneself is a dangerous road. I like how this film mentioned meditating, similarly to the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution. I think it is really cool how two of the films we watched recommended meditating. Meditating helps self reflect and let go of the unnecessary things we have in our life. This film shows so many successful wealthy people talking about why their success, money and things didn't satisfy them or make them happy. In many cases it made them sad. So many Americans think that things will make them happy and advertising companies target that. It is unfair in my opinion the way that advertising companies exploit us. I liked the way the film showed so many ways to live a minimalist lifestyle and the fact that Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus toured around talking to many different types of groups small and large. I also liked the way they said they aren't against consumption (which is unrealistic) but they are against meaningless consumption, two very different things. I have gotten rid of many things that don't add purpose to my life: clothes I don't wear, an extra backpack I don't use, miscellaneous items and I've redistributed many of these items to my friends. I have noticed that having less makes me feel much less stressed. Having so many items before felt cluttered and overwhelming. Now I feel organized and in more control. I try not to let things happen and want to take over my life and my happiness. I think it is something that is so important for people to be aware of and apply to their own lifestyles.

Does materialistic life make my life happy? well, as a “sneakerhead”, having a lot of pair of shoes does make me feel happy sometimes, but what about other stuff like clothes? I looked into my closet full of clothes, some of which I wore once or twice, right after watching the video and immediately got a answer to the question that I asked myself: NO. What are some concerns about having a closet full of clothes? Here are the answers: I bought two sets of hangers when I moved in, I throw T-shirts that I wear for 5 minutes into the laundry basket because I believe I have other T-shirts to wear for the next few days, I have to fold my whole basket of clothes and hang it up every time when I do my laundry, I spend time figuring out how to match my outfits everyday when I wake up, I have anxiety about my most expensive jacket being stolen…Having a lot of clothes does not make me happy, in fact, it makes me feel tired, stressful, and anxious. Moreover, I’m ashamed of my wasteful lifestyle, especially in an era where climate change has been proved to be more and more  harmful. I think it’s time for me to change my concept of purchasing from “what I can afford” to “what I actually need” and to clean up my closet a little bit.

The film Minimalism might be my favorite one that we have watched so far. Minimalism has always fascinated me so getting to watch this documentary gave me a broader view on what minimalism really is and how it can really affect one’s lifestyle. A few things that the film brought to my attention that I did not notice beforehand was the effect of advertising and just how much of it there really is. Advertising is literally everywhere, it is impossible to escape, which is why humans buy so many things. We have so many things that we don’t even have enough room to store all of them in our homes which is why people have storage units. I never thought about how crazy it is that we have to buy extra space to put all of our junk in. If that doesn’t tell you that we as humans have a serious shopping problem then I don’t know what would. One thing that was mentioned in the film was the fact that a lot of people try to fill voids in their lives with material things. I believe that more people than not are guilty of doing this. However, what we need to realize is that having material things is not the answer to all of our problems and definitely isn’t what is going to make us happy. Even the richest people who have an abundance of expensive things may not be happy. In fact, it is more often that it is those rich people who do have the most who are the most unhappy. The saying “money can’t buy you happiness” is not a myth, and this film completely backs up that statement. If anything, simplicity and minimalism are the most effective way to achieve happiness.
</p><hr>


<p>
Both the reading and the film “Minimalism” dive into the link between material things and happiness. Is it possible to live a satisfying life with less? Why do we depend our happiness on what we own? What would it take for us to move beyond this idea? These are some of the overarching questions that need to be considered when talking about consumerism. I think it is a powerful film because it highlights people that are attempting the challenge Throeau poses. The challenge to live a life that is different from the status quo. The climate crisis will require that from all of us. In a world with finite resources, we must learn how to live with less instead of infinitely consuming that which does not belong to us.

</p><hr>


<p>
I think “Minimalism” is such a great film because, although, not environmentally focused helps us find a solution for consumerism and it’s adverse effects on the planet. Joshua’s and Ryan’s first hand experiences of how they kept purchasing more goods in an attempt to fill some sort of void in their life but to no avail is something I think most people can relate to. We think if we buy this or that it’ll add substance to our life, that it’ll fulfill us in ways nothing else can. Eventually, you realize that material things after a certain point will not bring you satisfaction or happiness because there’s always something left to purchase. 
<br><br>
I think everyone can adapt minimalistic practices in their lives and sometimes it makes more sense. I would rather have one good jacket that’ll last me a long time than 10  that I’ll stop wearing when it’s no longer in ‘season’. Not only is it more practical to have less stuff but it also allows for more space in your life that you can fulfill with things you like doing. However, I do think that for many people this would be a major sacrifice and something that would seem impossible considering how capitalistic the United States is and how embedded consumerism is in our culture. You can’t really blame people for buying so much stuff when it’s idolized everywhere to the point it’s the only indicator of success. Success only being attainable once you have the nice car and big house.

The idea of minimalism is an interesting one. Largely, as Professor Hiltner points out, the idea of “minimalism” has historically come from not being able to afford things rather than purposefully not buying items. But in the past few years, those who can afford to buy many things – those in the first world – have conceptualized buying less for a number of reasons, including the “aesthetic of it”. It’s an interesting concept. The film itself attempts to explore how “things” always disappoint us, and how buying things cannot always fix what is wrong – advocating for and exploring for the concept of minimalism. It’s a very interesting film, and one that I hadn’t seen before this class. Seeing rich individuals attempt to “minimize” their lives was weird, because all our lives, we’ve been taught that if you can afford to buy something, you should buy it. We fill our lives with things.

“I was living paycheck to paycheck. Living for stuff. But I wasn’t living at all.” The film Minimalism has not only opened my eyes on what it truly means to be happy, but it has also opened my eyes on some of my own habits. I can admit that I’ve fallen under this normalized consumerist culture and that it can get very addicting at times. This need to buy more and to consume more is not something that I had noticed. It is true that eventually we get dissatisfied and need to obtain new items to once again fill that void for the time being. This is no way to truly live. Not only is this damaging to oneself, it also has a profound effect on our world, as our need to consume and satiate ourselves is not something that planet earth can handle. I had not realized how ingrained into our society this need to consume and spend money had been. We get advertisements for useless junk all the time. I don’t think I’ve experienced a day, an hour, perhaps even a minute without being advertised a “necessity that will improve my life.” Much of our success and “knowing you made it” depends on what we own. Hell, even my family still heavily follows this mindset. They wait in anticipation for days like black friday where we buy a plethora of junk that we don’t even need and forget about in a year. As simple as being a minimalist may sound, it is actually quite difficult. We have to come to terms with ourselves and truly give up what is not integral in our lives. Breaking out of an addiction is always hard. If I want to have a positive impact on this world and ultimately beat anthropogenic climate change, partaking in a movement like this is not only important, but necessary.

Replying to your final sentence first, I think that humans as a species and as the creators of this problem are the only ones that can fix it, and the solutions are necessary and also RADCIAL. I agree and do the same as you in terms of procrastinating until the last minute on an assignment as I am doing with this one, but if you turn in a paper late the world will not end. If humans procrastinate until gnarly effects of climate change are felt by all species on earth, it will already be too late to bring back species that have gone extinct and reverse some of the positive feedback loops will will ensue...

The concept of minimalism is truly something that should be promoted and advocated more frequently. Living a simplistic lifestyle does not mean one lacks capitol, as it is often misconceived as such. As seen in the short youtube videos, studies have shown that overconsumption is often linked to depression and lack of self esteem. We live in a materialistic society where one’s wealth and social status is often defined by one’s materialistic possessions. However, I truly believe that one can live a happier, more peaceful life than a person who is able to afford endless material things. We must start promoting freedom of consumption to free our minds and ultimately live a happier, simpler life.

Watching the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” was really interesting because I don’t think I have ever watched anything like it. I enjoyed seeing how both the men in the film went around the country to promote their book and  lifestyle to others. One of the scenes that shocked me the most was when it shows the men’s suitcases of what they packed for promoting their book. I have never seen anyone live out of a suitcase that small, let alone with that many clothes for 10 months. Seeing their suitcases made me think of what my suitcases look like when I pack to go home for winter break. It made me realize how much unnecessary clothing I own. It was shocking to learn how in the fashion industry there used to be two to four seasons and currently there are 52 seasons, one season per week. It’s saddening that brands try to get consumers to buy their clothing as soon as possible and see how they get rid of their clothes by cutting items weekly to make room for new items. Brands don’t care if their items harm our planet , they just want to profit off of customers. This film does an excellent job of demonstrating how a lifestyle change can make an environmental impact. We live in a time where more and bigger is seen as better and more successful, when in reality that is not the case. I think it might be possible for us to maximise minimalism by building our society and economy on less materialistic values. If people are informed more about the consequences of their actions, including what they purchase, it can bring a greater good for us and the planet. However, I do not think everyone is willing to completely dive into minimalism how this film demonstrates it.

In all honesty, before watching the film and this video, I did not understand the point of the minimalist lifestyle. I, like the majority of people in the developed world, have always bought in to the idea of consumerism. If I saw something in the store or online (usually the latter) then I would research it a little, and if I thought it was worthwhile I would buy it. I like to think that I did not really waste anything, I did. Even though I used the things that I bought, they were not necessary to have. The things I bought were always fun or useful to have, but they were rarely necessary. If I did not buy the majority of the items that I decided that I wanted, my life would not be much different. I know for a fact that I would not be any less happy without the things I buy. But, buying these things, and knowing that I am able to buy these things is fun for the short-term. It does not translate into the long-term at all, but it definitely feels good to have new things in the short term. After watching the film and this video, however, I see that there are far more pros to living a minimalist lifestyle than that of a consumerist, and also less cons. The biggest pro of all of course is helping the environment and greatly decreasing our carbon footprints. The only real con is that we do not get buy fancy things that we do not really need to make ourselves feel happy for a little. I think I am willing to give that fake happiness up to help save the planet.

From watching the documentary "Minimalism," I learned that leading a minimalistic life can be extremely beneficial for not only my personal life but also for everyone's as well. Everyday, I see many individuals I society engaging in a consuming life and economy in order to attain happiness and comfort. They want to fill their content with having what they want, whether they need it or not. Although it is nice to have the things we want in the moment, people must think about the effects our consumeristic attitude has on us in the long run. Our minds and the entire society is being corrupted every day with our materialistic greed, being blind to what truly brings great and positive values to our lives. We forget and ignore the small and simple things in life that can bring us comfort as much as our materialistic passions. This video is the true reminder for not only myself but for everyone out there to attempt on living a minimalist life. It is beneficial to our mindset and the environment. Having less greed and focusing on the values that will help society should be the goal for a better future.

I was a very fortunate (and spoiled) child growing up. I never asked for new toys or new clothes, yet my family would buy them for me anyways. Over time, this treatment began to make me feel entitled to always getting the newest toy, the newest softball bat, the newest iPad, the newest iPhone, the newest anything. I didn’t necessarily rely on these items for happiness, but they didn’t exactly make me upset either. As grateful as I am for all the things my family did and bought for me, when I watched “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” it almost made me wish that I hadn’t grown up manifesting an entitlement to new things that I still feel today. It now seems so hard for me and so many others to just easily reject the societal norm that our monetary value reflects our personal value. Watching the film and seeing that people are living perfectly fine lifestyles without an excessive amount of material goods shouldn’t have been as foreign of a concept to me as it felt. I personally want to start taking small steps into breaking out of the reigns of excessive consumerism. I know it’ll take a while for me to be comfortable relinquishing some of my bad habits, but any small progress is still better than no progress. I really would like to bring back some of what I learned to my family, because I know they have the same bad habits as I do. I hope I can get six people (me + my siblings & parents) to reduce their consumer habits by any amount.

Minimalism has always been an attractive topic for me, it argues the necessity of people owning a lot of clothes, that most of them might be a waste of money, resources, and space. I love to buy clothes and I own tons of them, to be honest, many that I bought a while ago are even brand new and still have their labels on. In the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” Josh and Ryan expressed the idea that owning less means living more and I can tell from the movie that their lives are both happier now as a minimalist than before. Just like the opening of the film shows, the consumer culture we have now is kind of “deformed”, people pour into the store, fighting each other just to buy the stuff they want. We are addicted to the material world and neglected what’s more important is to save our time to live for ourselves, find true happiness in life and pay more attention to the relationship between people. Just as the film says, people are “living paycheck to paycheck, living for stuff, but not really living.” Actually, before I watch the film and these videos, I’m already influenced by many influencer’s “clearout challenge” videos and had a thought in my mind about donating my extra things to the charity shop, after watching them my thoughts are even stronger, I will definitely put in action.

I completely relate to your desire to be more minimalist, since as you pointed out, it strays us away from valuing material things and instead towards prioritizing other people and our relationships with them, an intangible and very much inherent aspect of human nature that I think some people take for granted. In times like this, where anthropogenic climate change continues to shape our planet for the worse, we have no use for a consumer culture; I'd very much prefer a people culture over consumerism any day. Like you, I'm also thinking of decluttering my closet and only keeping the things that I find actually give me joy and I value having, but "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" also made me consider taking a look at the things I own in general, to reevaluate what I need and what I simply don't. I find it fascinating that decades ago, President Jimmy Carter gave a speech to the entirety of America on the dangers of consumerism. His point that "human identity is no longer defined as what one does, but by what one owns" struck a chord in me, since it made me realize that I have never thought about how much our stuff controls our lives; everything from our decision making to what rung we are on the social ladder is very much influenced by what we own, not necessarily what we do to "improve ourselves" and make ourselves appear better. I hope that I'll never forget the insightful, thought-provoking statements that appear in this documentary time and time again, as I want to share the ideas behind minimalism with as many people as I can.

    Yes, I totally agree with what you are saying. And as Ken said before, we should fundamentally reinvent Western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that happiness is to be found in things.

After the past four weeks of discussing the massive global impact of humans on the planet, it was somewhat of a pleasant experience to see a chapter dedicated to the ways humans can reduce their negative effect on the planet. The Netflix documentary Minimalism was like a crash course on everything minimalism and was very easily digestible. Sadly, it seems like transition from deeply rooted consumerism to less impactful practices is being delayed by laypeople who are reluctant to have their things taken away. The film does a very successful job explaining to viewers that minimalism does not involve an impractically sparse life that spawns from throwing away your personal items. This would not be entirely productive while also just contributing unnecessary personal impacts. Minimalism simply promotes consuming exactly the amount you need to meet that equilibrium balance of productivity without clutter. If the personal mental and spiritual benefits aren’t compelling enough, the reduction in carbon consumption should be the driving argument. Billions of articles of clothing are created, marketed, moved and destroyed just to satisfy our shallow tendencies. This becomes an issue, and cannot just be a facet of modern life when you consider how every aspect of that industry is effectively smothering the planet very aggressively. Each major industry is effectively doing that, so any personal mitigation against massive climate change is a positive thing.

I watched the minimalism, and I found the concept of minimalism is useful for us to gain a peaceful mind. As I reduced the number of new clothes I brought, I focused more on my study and real interest that genuinely makes me happy. If not, I would spend more time considering which clothe I should wear the next day. I have too many shoes for a different event, but now when I am in college, I found those shoes are somewhat useless, and I don’t even have the chance to wear them. Unlike many fancy high heels I have, I found I would rather wear more comfortable sneakers.

After watching this film, I am considering to sell or donate most of my clothes, because in college I just don’t have that amount of energy to think about the outfits or the appearance. However, I feel it is helpful when I concentrate more on my inner value and my health. As this kind of lifestyle is environmentally friendly, I am more willing to try it to a more significant extent. Therefore, I could focus on what I have to make the best use of it.

<p>
Going through college, I’ve already been somewhat living a minimalist lifestyle as I’ve never really had much belongings in my living spaces when compared to my roommates. Despite this, I did feel at times I just wanted more for apparently no reason at all. It may have just been a sense of comfort to have more belongings that I looked for, but after looking at this film I realized I’m just drifting towards being a consumer with a void I’m trying to fill through external products. I should be comfortable with what I currently own as it provides all the necessary items for a suitable life. This film showed me that I can and should be looking for ways to minimize what I use in order to help the environment.

From my last comment on the Thoreau reading, you can tell that I don’t completely agree with the argument of complete minimalism. I didn’t completely enjoy this film but my view on Minimalism and consumerism definitely shifted. As with Thoreau, I agree with some of the points but not all of them. My favorite takeaway from the film is that we should justify to ourselves that everything we have or own adds inherent value to our lives. After hearing this, I guess I am already kind of a minimalist myself(along with many college students). I always think very deeply before I buy anything and most of the clothes I own I have had for many years. I feel this takeaway is very important for everyone, but even more important to spread to the older generation who has more money to burn. We don’t need houses as big as they are or multiple cars. As they say in the film, the issue of consumerism is a societal one and that’s how we have to attack it. We can’t force the issue of complete minimalism, but a slow change of state of mind in terms of consumerism in the younger generation is the only way we will be able to implement any form of minimalism in the world. 
<br><br>
This may sound like I am completely agreeing with the film, but there were some aspects that I didn’t enjoy. For example, I feel this film is being a little too radical on the idea of Minimalism just as Thoreau was. I really disliked the part of the film about technology. I don’t believe that we are obsessed with our technology or hypnotized. We have the knowledge of the whole human race in our hands and we can do virtually anything on our technological devices so I think saying we are hypnotized and that phones and technology are harmful is wrong. The irony here is that even though some people feel technology is harmful for the younger generation, this technology could be the reason for our planet being saved if politics are futile. I believe we should embrace technology and progress.
<br><br>
I also don’t think that the issue of minimalism should be connected to the issues of a capitalist society and big business. I think this is counter productive to the true message of how minimalism can make our lives better and the environment better. Even though capitalism is connected with consumerism, I don’t think there will be any changing of that in terms of politics or how companies run themselves.

I absolutely agree with you that minimalism cannot be forced onto society. The drive to start a minimalist lifestyle must come from within from one's own beliefs and morals, similar to politics. When you try to force your political beliefs on someone with a different set of beliefs, it usually has the opposite effect than intended (indifference, anger, etc.). Substitute minimalism into this idea instead, and you will see people becoming upset over someone attacking their particular lifestyle. I also think that the idea of voluntary minimalism, aka what the film is basically promoting, is one formulated by wealthier individuals who already have the privilege of buying less stuff. Not to say that there are less fortunate individuals partaking in voluntary minimalism, but I think it's wrong for people in more comfortable positions to try and push this type of lifestyle on those who may not already have a conscious choice to do so. In my opinion, I did feel subtle undertones of this in the film.
<br><br>
Since our generation (for the most part at least) was raised on the same consumerist addiction that our parents and grandparents were raised on, I think that we are already a bit behind on trying to get this generation to make the switch to a less-is-more type of lifestyle. However, I could be wrong. If we are able to convince the majority of our generation to abandon excessive consumerism, I believe that we will also have the power to spread it to not only future generations, but also our parents' and grandparents' generations.

The film "Minimalism" was a great piece that showed and promoted the simple minimalist lifestyle that could be the potential future. With smaller homes and drastically fewer belongings, lives were seen to become much simpler and purer as less money was needed to pay for this lifestyle so more free time was spent doing things that brought actual joy to life. 
<br><br>
While we currently are stuck in a materialistic capitalist society, I truly believe that minimalist lifestyles will become very popular in the new future as it is a quirky and beneficial way to help reduce one's carbon footprint while enhancing people's lives. Just how thrifting and becoming vegan have popularized recently as trends, the style of minimalistic living does not seem unreasonable to predict it will popularize. With more people partaking in this lifestyle fewer goods will be demanded and companies will slow do production, causing a much smaller amount of greenhouse gases to be emitted. People's lives will gain more value as anxiety and stressing over materials becomes a thing of the past. The only limiting factor I see is the hit it will take on our economy. As so many of these goods are purchased by homeowners to fill their empty spaces with random products a decrease in these will take a heavy hit on production companies, lowering production and overall lowering down our gdp. While I am unsure of the main resulting factors of this I am still very sure that minimalism is a plausible option that at the very least is worth the try.

<p>
So what is most important right now is self reflection to our consumer ways. Another way to combat climate change is minimalism. Having only what you need and getting rid of what you don't. Like we learned in Econ, when the demand for a good decreases so will the supply, thus decreasing the production of the good which will decrease destruction on the environment to create these goods. I do think being minimalistic can have a great impact on our way to sustainability/Eco friendly. We have built such a massive market on buying more than necessary, it's time to regulate it. Time and time again I'll see friends and family buying the latest whatever, getting in-trend with whatever, and buying cute/cool because we feel the need to "hunt" for new things (I fall into this consumer trap too). We have been conditioned to fall in line with capitalism's non-sustainable life way.

The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was an interesting watch for me. I "thoureau"-ly enjoyed seeing how two best friends took on the journey in spreading the word of the lifestyle that is minimalism. As much as I support the idea and how rewarding it must feel having a huge burden get off your back, being pressured by society to keep up with trends, I wonder how people are able to travel around the world without working. For example, the guy who only carried two bags was technically "homeless", yet he was able to travel where ever he pleased. The only way I see that this would be possible is by saving up money from a job, live minimalist at the same time, then use those funds to travel. Yet, this is everyone's goal already if you think about it. 
<br><br>
Living minimalist is already a thing for many minorities;  living in poverty. The main point is that being able to live a GOOD minimalist life requires a good amount of money to still have that sense of "freedom". I would personally like to try minimalism, but I don't think I'm ready yet.

The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” could not have been more aptly named. Now the reason I say this is because when analyzed and studied, the minimalists are simply truly trying to get the rest of the public to see what’s important about life and what’s not. There was a quote that was said that stated something along the lines that “We are as materialistic as possible and yet not materialistic in the true sense of the word.” There was so much meaning in this statement because of its honesty. We are materialistic because of all the materials we insist on buying and collecting and hoarding. Yet, are we truly materialistic when all these things we seem to need to collect, we don’t appreciate the true value of.
<br><br>
As I watched the film, I caught myself thinking of all the things I’ve bought up until now simply because I convinced myself that I needed them. I felt even foolish how easily I had collected so many things when in reality I use probably 30% of everything I have. It was a humbling experience to see everything I have through the eyes of the minimalists.
<br><br>
Seeing all the success stories of these individuals who managed to start a minimalist lifestyle and finally find happiness went to show that this desire that most have to continue to buy and consume is our response to what bigger production companies tell us to do and even what to want. Without realizing it we’re buying into the type of life that corporations all around are trying to sell. It’s not a matter of choosing to live a minimalist life, it’s a matter of realizing that what we’ve always wanted isn’t what we’ve wanted but what society has ingrained in us that we need.

While watching the documentary Minimalism, I could see where Josh and Ryan were coming from, but the possible life-changing effects of minimalism didn’t truly click for me until hearing Josh’s poem about the month when he both lost his mother and went through a divorce. Before, I understood that minimalism could save you money, and was a better lifestyle for the planet, but what I had yet to learn was how the focus on consumerism and the pursuit of money can harm your relationships, and vice versa, how breaking your dependence on stuff can lead to much richer, deeper relationships. I rewound to listen to the poem again, and on the second time through, the line “But even while Rome is burning, there’s somehow time for shopping at Ikea” brought tears to my eyes. After watching this film, I’m definitely going to reexamine my relationship with the things I own, and reconsider my habit of buying things I don’t need and don’t get use out of.
<br><br>
 As someone interested in design, the portion of the film dedicated to innovative housing, from tiny houses to adaptable apartments, fascinated me a lot. I love what the architect Frank Mascia said about our culture’s current relationship with our homes: “We’re living our life depending on the space we’ve got rather than creating our space to fit our lives.” The idea of living in a space that’s the correct size and style for you seems so simple and intuitive, but I think that many people are conditioned to seek out the biggest as most expensive living space that they can afford, rather than what they actually need. Especially since more space = more energy use, more land use, longer commutes and the temptation to fill empty space with more stuff, it has never been more important to live responsibly rather than lavishly.

I've always admired people like Joshua who can live a very minimalistic life. It's easy in theory but so hard to practice. My parents are currently planning to move to a different house, and I myself have to go back home and clean out so many of my things. I'm dreading sorting through the piles of clothing that I have purchased over the years, things that my parents probably spent hundreds of dollars on just for it to fall into the trash somewhere or go to Goodwill.  It's even more startling because I genuinely have been the same size for the majority of my life after seventh grade. The scenes in the documentary emphasizing the consumer at a typically shopping mall or store made me feel weirdly targeted throughout the movie in general. It's strange how things like trends take over our perception of what we need and what we don't, but Ken was right when he said that this was a first world problem. There's so many people in India who would love to wear something that I probably wore only a handful of times and didn't really enjoy the material or the way it flattered my body and felt the need to toss it out. While that makes me sound very materialistic and selfish, I genuinely never thought that there was much alternative to this way of life. I think that I will try to pursue a minimalistic lifestyle in the future though. I am constantly losing things, and I think that the film really proved to me that I wouldn't lose as much if I actually valued the things I had around me.

According to the short video of Visualizing a Plenitude Economy, the whole society is suffering due to many different reasons, such as economical crisis and environmental problems. When big companies and wealthy people are enjoying their time, the poverty and social discontent is actually rising. The video suggests that there is only one way to solve the problem that the country is facing right now, which is to expand production. However, at the same time it states that it is impossible to give everyone a job even though the production is expanded. The ultimate goal becomes to reduce ecological impacts and create jobs at the same time. It is important to control the growth that it will use up the resources, and people also need to build a new economic model and find new ways of living. The essential idea of a plenitude economy is the changing how we spend our time to reduce environmental impacts and create more jobs. The first thing will be reduce work time that it will reduce carbon emissions, more people will get work and also doing DIY things in their spare time to live a better life with less money. 
<br><br>
It is my first time to learn that reducing the working time can also help to solve the environmental problems that we are facing now. It seems like there are only negative sides of it, but after watching the video, I am more educated about how it can bring positive impacts to our society. With less working time, people will get more spare time to develop their own abilities and make their life better by inventing new things into their life, rather than just working all the time. And also people will tend to consume less resources and reduce the carbon emissions.

In the film “Minimalism” they discussed a pretty modern lifestyle I had only heard about. Moving away from all the excess clutter in your life and only keeping the essentials. In a fast moving and capitalist society this film showed me that a lot of what we own is not important. Plenty of people buy excessive, clothes, tech, and other random assortments of stuff that is not necessarily adding to their lives. These minimalist lifestyle choices are an interesting one that I would consider once I figure out what I am doing with my life. The added benefit to having less clutter is that it is better for the environment which is very appealing. A simpler life and you're saving the earth is quite intriguing. The people in this film were all heavily invested in the clutter lifestyle but I would consider myself in the middle. I'm definitely not a minimalist but I don't horde anything I don't need and tend to get rid of useless stuff. This film helped me realize and I can better my lifestyle and help the environment by just living a simpler life and that seems like a pretty good deal. Hopefully more people pursue the minimalist lifestyle.

Like Ken mentioned, Minimalism is a first-world solution for first-world problems. The whole concept of minimalism just displays the joke of a society we are, we need a movement to tell us we don't need 50 pairs of shoes, with 50 matching jackets. But this is capitalism at its best, it has convinced a whole nation that more/bigger equals better and success. It has convinced us that we need to buy the new version of the iPhone with just a minor improvement to its appearance because our friend did already, and are we going to let our friend outdo us. Are we not able to buy the new version as well? These are the type of thoughts we are fed through advertisements and social media.
<br><br>
A great example in the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” is when the news reporter is talking about his experience with minimalism and how he was socially perceived. His friends and family were not curious but worried about him. They asked him if he was okay and placed a label on him, they viewed him differently just because he didn't splurge on things like they did. This is the type of mentality capitalism has created, and throughout the film, we are shown that it is destroying us.

After watching the documentary Minimalism, I was so impressed and fascinated by the notion of minimalism that could lead not only to a lifestyle of low carbon footprint but also a one that leads to happiness. The stories of the two featured minimalists in the documentary really resonate with me as I was watching-- I used to think that minimalism is to live a primitive or “barbaric” way of life. But now, I came to realize that it is a way to get out of the so many traps that consumerism has created on our everyday life: addiction to fast fashion, depression caused by short of material substances, and relentless fatigue in organizing life as “good” as possible. At the age of 20, I finally come to realize that these things have kept me trapped for so long that were the ultimate sources of my everyday struggle with myself and with my life. 
<br><br>
I always questioned myself am I actually happy for purchasing a 500 dollar cloth, or do I really look cool on these cloth. Shopping has taken up so much of my time and I believe it does for many people like me. But while we are fascinated about fast fashion and luxury clothes, we never asked ourselves do we really need them? Are we purchasing it because we don’t have clothes to wear or are we buying it because consumer culture and the brand culture is something we worship on a daily basis? Are these sneakers necessarily more comfortable than those bought 2 years ago? Are these jackets actually warmer than the ones that my dad gave to me? We constantly ignore the practicality of products we purchase, instead, we lost ourselves in many ways in the luminous and fancy life portrayed by the media and by the market. The logic is simple, I remember something I have studied in a religious study course that we are actually now making “god”. Our belief that something is of a divine presence or so important that we can’t be happy or feel relieved if we don’t purchase it. The manufactured good of our own labor is now constraining our lives-- it is ridiculous for human beings to worship “god” created on their own. Brandings, luxury goods, high-end products, and everything that create a sense of “Nobel” or “satisfaction” are actually created by our own hands. This is really a question that deserves discussion and every one of us should reflect on it.

I think the film makes an interesting point about the insatiable nature of a materialistic society, about always being on the hunt for the next thing to satisfy an itch. It's something that I've been struggling with recently, actually. No matter what I buy or do, I never seem to be satisfied with what I have. That's not to say that I am ungrateful, but that I have become addicted to the rush I get when I insert my card or open that Amazon package. Unsurprisingly, I stumbled upon minimalism before I even enrolled in this class. I stumbled upon it through a Netflix series called "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo", a show in which a woman helps people organize their belongings by letting go of things that do not spark joy in them. The narrative is incredibly similar to the stories told by the narrators of "Minimalism". 
<br><br>
I've noticed a lot of my classmates have seemingly drawn the line at minimalism, and a lot of the comments I've seen all label minimalism as a great solution that a lot of people will just not execute. Which is strange considering the amount of effort it takes to buy and consume less is infinitely smaller than the effort it takes to go vegetarian, which a lot of people seemed to support. I think downsizing and limiting your personal consumption to items that make you happy and serve a purpose is one of the easiest changes a person can make to help the environment, and the popularity of modern decorating styles and shows like "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo" prove that these changes in lifestyle seem to have a market.
<br><br>
Side note: I really appreciate that the narrators touched on the idea and benefits of having a collection. As someone who collects, it feels good to know that as long as my collection adds to my overall utility, it is worth having in a minimalist ideology.

I viewed the two short films "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism" and was quite intrigued by what was mentioned. In the first video altering the workweek to make lives better for citizens and have them do things that make them happy is a great idea and would, as a result, lessen the emission of greenhouse gases, so it's truly a win-win. Changing how we spend our time could actually result in a cultural shift in the US as over the years work hours have gone up and this would make for happier, healthier people. Getting involved in DIY projects is good due to the fact that developing hobbies or passions is a great way to exercise creativity and possibly make money. Then with the second video, the focus on tying economic growth with consumer culture is dangerous as it doesn't really do much for the individual, only corporations benefit by getting more money in their pockets. But by spending it really doesn't even do much for the person as their lives aren't any happier, so consumerism just messes with the psyche and hurts the planet. Materialistic values need to be discouraged which could be made possible if people don't go shopping to make themselves feel better and finding a different coping strategy or a big change would be living more of a minimalist lifestyle. The media also plays a role in increasing a need for more, so it is in one's best interest to use ad block or mute when commercials come on. But something really important is promoting intrinsic values as being internally motivated leads to a well rounded, happier individual; policy change would also be necessary as that would mean there is an actual implementation of trying to improve the wellbeing of the people. So, I would like to say they were both great videos, but it's also important to address capitalism as an oppressive system that feeds off of the suffering of poorer countries, which is how consumerism and certain industries have grown. Humankind isn't creating this damage on a global scale, it's mainly the US, Russia, and Britain, but the US has so many systems in place so it can be difficult to try to adjust things.
</p><hr>


<p>
A common thing I hear from my girlfriends after a bad day or draining week is "retail therapy."  This term contradicts itself and the points made by short film, "The High Price of Materialism," it's right to say that the importance placed on having many and marvelous material items actually makes people unhappy and unfulfilled.  It's a trick brands play on us when they release new items and market them as highly desirable or unique to anything else we've seen before; the crazy part is how good they are at advertising this to us and how we believe it every time.  I found it a little sickening to learn that over 150 billion dollars most years go toward advertising and marketing items to be purchased.  That enormous amount of money could be going towards implementing the new model economy described in the YouTube shortfilm, "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy," that would actually benefit the majority of society.  
<br><br>
Really, the term "retail therapy" sucks because buying unnecessary material items is not what therapy is about.  It's about choosing to do things that actually make you happy and bring you joy, not just the illusion of it.  I agree with one of the messages made in these videos that instead of material items being prioritized, we need to establish the importance of spending time with family and friends, choosing a more climate-sensitive lifestyle.
</p><hr>


<p>
One thing I think both of the short films emphasized is the way that consumer culture detracts from interpersonal connections, which in turn detracts from happiness. The loneliness epidemic facing our world today is, I believe, caused both by the overuse of technology in place of genuine human interaction and by the promotion of the “hustle” lifestyle: working as hard and long as you can in order to earn as much money and status as you can.
<br><br>
One quote that really stood out to me from “The High Price of Materialism” was, “People focus more on material things when they feel insecure.” In my experience this statement has proved to be overwhelmingly true. Our current society, especially the beauty industry, profits off of our being insecure. So many companies try to sell us the idea that their products will make us happier, will make us loved, and will therefore give us worth. They try to make consumers insecure so that we’ll buy their products in a desperate attempt to “fix” ourselves when there is nothing truly broken. This also brings up the unhealthy trend of retail therapy, which I myself am immensely guilty of. As the video suggests, we need to stop the habit of filling a metaphorical void within ourselves with material possessions, and instead focus on developing healthy coping mechanisms.
<br><br>
In our everyday life we're overwhelmed by advertisements, telling us that if we buy this fancy car, or that expensive watch, we’re buying ourselves status and giving ourselves worth. Our worth, however, does not come from our accumulation of stuff, and when we die, we can’t take any of it with us. I know that when I come to the end of my life, I won’t wish that I’d worked longer hours, made more money, and had more possessions; I’ll wish that I’d spent more time with the people I love and doing the things I love, so that’s what I’m going to focus on before I get there.

Minimalism is a thing that I constantly see on my youtube timeline (thank you to the algorithm). However I never watched a single video because I am a person who loves fashion (not particularly fast fashion though). I did not want to hear about something that would make me feel guilty or make me want to clean out my entire closet--it sounds a little silly, I know. But it's true. After watching this film, I have come to the realization that minimalism is not just about decluttering your closet. It is more about the consumerism culture that we all fall victim to unfortunately. The film made me a little sad but also inspired to experiment with my way of living. Not only is it better for climate but for culture and my happiness. I also really enjoyed the tiny house segment of this film because I have been so interested in alternative living spaces. So it boggles my mind that some people can't wrap their head around this concept. Like Ken stated, it is a concept a toddler can understand. A simple concept for a simple life. Sounds great to me. Before all these films and readings, I sat here scratching my head on what I can contribute but now I am getting these simple answers and they are more the doable. Why did I think fashion industry would die? All that would change is the unhealthy culture of it all...this need for excess.

<p>
To be honest, I really like the movie "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," which introduces me to a whole new lifestyle. I didn't know what consumerism was, but I would be confused by some people who keep buying things they don't need. When I understood the concepts of consumerism and minimalism, I understood that minimalism is in my favor. People should control their consumption and not be guided by advertising. People living in rich countries need to pay more attention to this problem.
</p><hr>

<p>
The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” inspired me to lead a more minimalistic lifestyle. The film showed people living with only the bare necessities, yet they still lived happy lives. They did not need material objects to be happy as many of us believe we do. To answer Ken’s question, I do believe minimalism is an important response to the climate crisis. Consumerism is largely to blame for the severity of the climate crisis, and by cutting out many useless luxuries, we would greatly reduce the amount of CO2 we emit into the atmosphere annually. As Ken offered in last week’s lecture videos, reducing the amount of material objects we buy and buying secondhand items are just two small lifestyle changes we can make that would greatly benefit the planet.
</p><hr>


<p>
When I first began watching this movie, the appeal of a minimalistic lifestyle was mainly environmental, but also partially economical. I had not thought much about the emotional appeal of the lifestyle, but the benefits of lower stress and less materialist lifestyle calls to me. I value the little things in life, and I value my time, so the idea of having more free time is very appealing. The over arching theme of the movie is that quality of possessions is more important than the quantity of possessions owned. In the US the culture is one of consumerism, and has increased the level at which individuals consume things drastically in the past few years. In a more aesthetic based sense, the idea of beds that fold into walls, and tables that collapse are also highly appealing to mean, and are good ideas to optimize the use of space, not necessarily to fit more items in, rather, to create more space for living. 
<br><br>
The entire point of this movie is that we do not need much of what we buy, and follows the ideas of Thoreau, and this view is important to increasing sustainable practices, and destressing. In a similar sense, minimalists like Thoreau practice in all ways including home size, clothing, possessions and simplifications. The success of others, as stated in this movie is encouraging and emphasizes that minimalism is possible, and enjoyable. 
<br><br>
The film also plays with the idea of spreading oneself too thin by trying to do everything you want to do, simply because you can. Prior to this film I never considered how cell phones play into a minimalists lifestyle, but the idea of instant gratification and wanting more from materials is similar to that of cell phones and is a stress inducing practice. Simply removing that object can remove the stress which comes with it. I enjoyed the analogy about worrying that one was going to miss a flight, a very similar idea to the worry one associates with material goods. I appreciate the message of this movie and plan on sharing it with friends and family, and perhaps reading the book, or moving towards a more minimalist lifestyle (im already somewhat minimalist), or at least reconsider how much I need an object before purchasing it.
</p><hr>


<p>
To start, the 1970’s prediction is quite a shocking idea to imagine. These scientist already knew our over consumption as human beings would cause trouble and eventual climate change to planet Earth. Yet sadly, no one in the older generations did anything about. This does tie my thoughts back to Ken’s lecture videos describing the same sad reality.  I do think this idea of Plentitude Economy is interesting because it allows us to care for the environment in a better way and relax the tensions and struggles most human beings have. The idea brought up about working less and sharing the work load sounds great but I believe is hard to attain in some ways. A lot of people need to pay heavier bills and work those longer hours which in turn does create more stress. This relates to the second video regarding the consumerism society and influence on our well being and social relationships. The fact it also affects feelings of insecurity and takes away from the problem only for monetary time. I also like the policies other countries have placed, taken more care to their people’s well-beings and happiness than their own GDP.

I had seen short bits and pieces of the movie Minimalism prior to watching it for this class, and had taken a certain level of interest in it, but never did go back to finish the movie or really explore what it means to adopt a minimalist lifestyle, but after watching this movie, I think that minimalism is going to be incredibly important to try and adopt for much of the developed world. I have always wanted to rid myself of many of my excess possessions. Living in Isla Vista and sharing a small room with another person alone has made me want to rid myself of the majority of my possessions in an attempt to declutter my life, save money, and generally contribute less as an individual to the overall issue of climate change. That being said, I think it is extremely important that minimalism takes over as a cultural movement in society. While attempting to reduce any and all excess from one’s life can be helpful in contributing to one’s individual carbon footprint, it will take a complete overhaul of capitalism and the way we consume on a global level in order to make a lasting impact. Capitalism has allowed this consumerism we subscribe to to run rampant in society and become a global phenomena. Developed countries around the world like the United States and Canada largely define their high quality of life by the size of their houses, the number and type of cars they own, the amount of dollar signs in their bank account, or the monetary value of their material possessions. 
<br><br>
As many people have mentioned in similar comments in previous videos, many of us can see these views reflected in the behavior of our own parents. For most students in this class, the age of their parents likely falls somewhere between the ages of 45 and 60, placing them at a birthdate between 1960 and 1975. During these years, the chief concerns of the American populus for the future of the next generation were to graduate with a degree, do it quickly, land a solid high paying job, buy a big house, buy a car, start a family, and finally, to give their children a better life than they themselves had ever had the opportunity to experience. Somewhere along the way, the sense of security and worth that Americans were desperate to fill manifested into an all consuming compulsion to buy, buy again, and then buy some more after that. We tell ourselves that we’ve earned it, that we deserve it, but what purpose are all of our “things” really filling? They serve to force us into a 40+ hour work week, a forced system of labor under the very same system that threatens to destroy both society and much of the planet (though the planet will survive long after we have died).
<br><br>
 I know for a fact that I have a great number of items that I could throw away right now and not even notice that they were gone. I don’t need 8 sweaters, 6 pairs of jeans, 20 pairs of shoes, 5 jackets, or most of the things that I own and have considered to be (and been told were) essential for a happy life. We have been born into this; now it has become second nature. Addressing minimalism as a society rather than on an individual level, while also exploring alternate economic systems as mentioned in this video will both be key components in combatting the beast of consumerism that our government and capitalism have created.

<p>
"Minimailism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was an eye opening film for me. This film showed me how human beings are never satisfied with their possesssions. We are always looking for the next best thing or items that do not really improve our situation. This documentary proposed that we as humans should cut down on consumerism and waste and live ministically. Minimalism, to me, means that we possess items that are needed. For example, I do not think you need three yachts. 

<br><br>
I think living a minimalistic lifestyle is hard in this country. With this country right now, capitalism has been the driving force economically. The way products are being marketed in this country is scary and honestly I take part in consumerism. I am looking around my room right now and I do see items I do not need. People love buying things and I do not know if that will ever stop. 

<br><br>
I will definitely look in my room and see what I do not need and donate those items. It is the least I could do. I am really enjoying these videos and readings we are assigned to look at.

    I agree that the documentary shocked me. Some of those men had everything that I would have hope for in life. These people had made it in life and they threw it away because they were so unhappy at their current situation. everyone is striving for a goal in which they think they would be happy but in the end are never satisfied. It was painful to see these people throw their jobs away but in the end I realize that the thing I thought would make me happy was a lie. Even if I was them I don't think I would have had the courage to drop everything and live for a minimalist life style. Many people are like me which is why our planet is in such a sorry state. However It made me reevaluate my definition of happiness and understand why I am working so hard to get a job I will most likely hate to impress people I will probably not like. With such harsh society standards I believe the culture will be the most difficult aspect to battle.

I believe living a minimalist lifestyle is a good path to take in order to make an impact on the environment. It reduces many negative issues that involve the world of consumerism. Such as heavy working hours that impact our wellbeing and physical state. Also working longer hours like mentioned in the film will help decrease the number of fossil fuels released and overall allow more time for people to spend time with their families and take part in things they enjoy doing which will help them practice intrinsic values. In addition to this, of course, materialistic things and produce would have to decrease in value as working hours also decrease. Practicing intrinsic values will not only benefit our mental state but also our value for materialistic objects will go down. People will be more prone to a minimalist lifestyle if they were living a life of gratitude, satisfaction, and happiness, but this will only happen if they are practicing intrinsic values and are financially stable. 
<br><br>
Living a minimalist lifestyle would make a difference in the climate crisis but will this lifestyle be for everyone? The wealthy would have no trouble switching to a minimalist lifestyle since they have the finances and resources to live this type of manner and wouldn't have to worry about missing basic human resources like food, water, electricity...etc. However, only the voluntary wealthy people that are willing to live a minimalist lifestyle and want to protect our earth would be in agreement to living this way. Any other wealthy person would have a hard time switching to this lifestyle because they have already accustomed themselves to their own lifestyle filled with expensive materialistic things and luxuries that make them "happy." In addition, many believe that since they worked extremely hard to get to the point they are now why wouldn't they be able to live the American dream that many strive for. Switching to a minimal lifestyle would just not be adequate for them and they wouldn't want to make the sacrifice to lower their social class. 
<br><br>
I understand that many people well off will not want to let go of their daily habits of buying clothes, shoes, driving cars...etc but it is only a little frustrating when they have all the resources and money to make a change but they don't try to limit their material expenses, they instead buy more to fulfill their likes and satisfactions. On the other hand, people struggling to live a decent life have no other choice but to live a minimalist lifestyle which I think is not fair because, for the most part, they are the ones producing less CO2 gases than the wealthy.

I had actually recently been thinking about trying out the minimalist lifestyle after realizing that I was consuming too much. I also just felt like my life was overall a bit too cluttered. So, it was perfect timing that we were assigned to watch the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things.” I had a basic idea of what minimalism was before watching the documentary, but I really enjoyed being able to see what minimalism really looked like and the effects that it had on Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus. Some things that I was happy to learn from the documentary are that the minimalist lifestyle could make me feel more free, help me save money, and lower my carbon footprint. I think we should definitely try to reinvent our materialistic culture. While I know it will be hard, I think once people are made aware of all the positive benefits of the minimalist lifestyle, there will be many that will be attracted to this lifestyle. I think it is definitely possible to change the views of many people, as I have seen myself personally change from a huge shopping lover that consumes more than an average person, to someone that is trying to change to a minimalist lifestyle.
</p><hr>


<p>
When thinking back on the film, “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” I immediately remembered by a cousin, as he was trying to practice minimalism. However, I immediately started thinking about how all the materialistic things that I own and how the majority of it never really spends a great amount of time with me. It made me question all the items, clothes, and my way of living, as it made me compare my lifestyle to those in the film. I do not believe that we can maximize minimalism within society if we try to have less materialistic values due to the fact that no matter what, there are always going to be greedy people that crave more. Many people might be willing to move into this type of lifestyle, but there will always be those individuals that refuse to and pull others to follow within their footsteps and their mentality.

I agree with your opinion. In the film Minimalism, we can learn that people are pursuing materialistic lifestyles too much. At the beginning of the movie,  it shows scenes of people who are crazy for discount stuff. That shows a really materialistic society we have having now. We put too much effort into buying good stuff and consuming goods. The film shows a converted house which adopts new ideas that can save a lot of room. I really like this idea. People nowadays are wasting too much. We always buy stuff and discard them. This is really bad for the earth’s sustainability. 33 project challenge is interesting because you can still yourself charming without wasting so much clothes.
<br><br>
It is not easy to change it because some people still want a better materialistic life. Ken talked about in his generation, people tend to pay less attention to material use and they hold different opinions. Young generations like us need to receive more education about the environment. We rely on social medias and we will be influenced by social medias trending easily.

The videos “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism” demonstrate the necessary steps to help people, both individually and collectively, become less environmentally destructive and lead better lives. One thing that is mentioned in the former video is a reduction in working hours. Even though it is known that the well-being of employees directly affects productivity in the workplace, I did not consider that a reduction in work hours could help people reduce their environmental impact by leaving them time to do more activities in their personal time. And it is interesting to hear that there are places in the world with 30 hour work weeks which helps with income disparity issues as well. It seems like this sort of change could be implemented in other regions as well as it brings about many positive effects. The fact that the government of some countries have already applied this effectively makes me hopeful that other regions will follow suit. 
<br><br>
In the latter video, similar to “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things”, the narrator stresses that materialism does not lead to happiness. Rather, on the contrary, studies have shown that it could negatively impact people’s mental health and lead to substance abuse. Even so, the media has made people think otherwise, and so people will continually buy products believing that it will improve their lives, is essential to economic growth, and has many other positive effects. Therefore, by living a more minimalist lifestyle and changing that ingrained mindset, people can have a better state of mind and also help reduce their impact on the environment. Based on both of these videos, actions that help the planet through individual, community, and policy efforts are also more beneficial to society and the individual.

According to the documentary “Minimalism”, fashion industry always tries to invent new styles, create a fashion trend and then takes advantage of the people’s psychology to follow there trend. Through such seasonal changes of fashion style, the fashion industry make a good deal of profit; however, this will cause a series damage to the planet not only by using a lot of resources but also the pollution. And as the price of clothing become cheaper and cheaper, the true cost behind such behaviors are hugely increasing. So it is of great importance for people to differentiate whether they are purchasing for what they really necessarily need, or are just misled by their desire to follow the trend or the advertisements from the industry.

"We are too materialistic in the everyday sense of the word and we are not at all materialistic enough in the true sense of the word."- Julia Shore. The consumerist society that we have been raised in emphasizes the social value of possessions as opposed to the personal value of it. I liked this documentary because "The Minimalists", Josh and Ryan genuinely seemed to care about their lifestyle and how it could affect the well-being of others. Like stated in the documentary, they aren't the traditional perception of what a "minimalist" is, like a monk or recluse. Instead, they emphasize only having things that you genuinely like. That isn't to say they can't have nice clothing that they genuinely appreciate, or a functioning laptop that helps them keep up with the world, it's just to have only a few of those things. I also really appreciated the part with Dan Harris, when he was differentiating the certain amount of worry that makes sense and the certain amount of worry that doesn't. So much of my life is preoccupied with worry but there is an extent where the worrying has no practical benefit besides making me more stressed. This aspect of life that I think minimalism can help prevent. 
<br><br>
Overall, I REALLY enjoyed the choices of reading and video today because I think it is an important aspect of the climate change that we often overlook. So many of our problems may be solved if we just make slight alterations in our lives and stop promoting the industries that cause so much harm to both our well-being and the planet itself. Once again, this isn't to say that we can't or shouldn't have material goods or possessions. Personally, the level of minimalism exhibited by Thoreau where he goes into the woods and lives off almost nothing is unfathomable for me to achieve. However, by cutting off a lot of the excess thing that I experience in life, I feel like I can genuinely make a difference in so many aspects.

I have started to practice mild minimalism before watching this film, and I really enjoyed getting to know Ryan and Joshua's personal growth after practicing minimalism. I feel like it has really helped me feel less cluttered, more organized, and more in-control of my own life. I delete all apps on my phone that I rarely use, I try my best to buy reusable and long-lasting items rather than disposable, waste-producing items, and I'm trying to significantly size down my wardrobe to a select number of clothes that I wear the most. The clothing aspect is the most difficult for me because I always think that I'll need a piece of clothing for the future for some random, obscure event that probably won't happen. My dad is a hoarder, so I grew up thinking that everything I own may have a use in the future, and it has been a challenge to overcome that mindset. When I was a kid and I lived in a house with my parents, the garage was chaotic and filled with so many random objects that you couldn't even walk through it. When we moved to Los Angeles, we gave most of our things away and threw away so much so that we could have space in our tiny apartment, which we keep very open and organized. Living in an open space that is free of the mess of so many miscellaneous items reallly made a difference in my home environment for the better, even if the actual square footage of our new living space was smaller than our previous home. I hope that many others choose to live more minimally and try to assess the clutter in their lives so that they can feel happier while helping the environment at the same time.

In the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I was especially moved by the serenity and happiness that the minimalist lifestyle seemed to provide. I think that the wellbeing of our society today is an aspect often overlooked. All that many politicians and economists seem to see is the data and not the people themselves. The interspersed video snippets from violent Black Friday events revealed consumerism and capitalism's ugly face and rooted a feeling of unease about the certain state of our society (if not already present) within the viewer. The idea of a "plenitude economy" was the most intriguing to me because it was a large scale solution to the same problems that minimalism looks to solve. I further looked into this after hearing Ken mention it, and I love the innovation, DIY eco intelligence, and community-building that it inspires. Minimalism seems to be a movement that could turn parts of the population, but some people are too rooted in their upbringing and the idea that their "wants" will satisfy their needs and their wellbeing. Due to this, I don't believe that minimalism is a large enough scale solution, although I do think that it is an idea that should be widely spread as to inspire those that may change their minds. Personally, a creative lifestyle is one that is important to me, so while I can see the value of reducing our ecological footprint through minimalism, I think that creations made by oneself and in our communities locally are acceptable possessions to have (whether that is art or other DIY items). 
<br><br>
Overall, this video has inspired me to look twice at the things I own and choose to buy. Much of it I do not really need. The amount of times I have looked into buying more stuff to store my current stuff in or on just proves that I probably have too much stuff. Like the example they used in the film, I too love my book collection and some of the other collectables I own, but there is still so much that I honestly do not need, and I will definitely be changing my lifestyle from here on out.

Minimalism is a documentary which introduces the simple life without unnecessary substances. The directors Joshua and Ryan share their own experiences about being minimalists and talk about their changes in the documentary.
<br><br>
For me, I think the most agree part in the film is that advertisements change how people purchase things. Once people only have 4 seasons in a year, so they only need 4 seasons’ clothes. They wear warm clothes in cold season and light clothes in hot season. However, the advertisements make people feel like they have 52 seasons in a whole year. To catch the fashion trend, people buy clothes every week, which are the things unnecessary. Perhaps some clothes you buy it and you will never wear it. It is scary that people totally change their notion of the value of substances. When an object loses its social value, it can be given up. This kind of notion not only put lots of burden on the environment, but also people themselves economically and mentally. People buy many things to catch the fashion to gain happiness from the substances, yet the happiness is void. I think it is important to ask ourselves a question before buying a thing: is it something I really need? Once when I lived in China, we have Double Eleven (a shopping season just like Black Friday). On Double Eleven, I always buy a lot of new things and chat with friends about things we purchase. It seems that buying things on shopping season has already been a tradition for people. When I watched the video that people wait outside the shops in the midnight and scramble for things and shout at each other, I feel shocked. People are controlled by lure at this time. It is not a correct consumption view. From then on, I start to buy things more rationally. Though I am not a minimalist, I am glad that I am a calm consumer.

Minimalism was one of my favorite films I had to watch for Engl 22. Hearing the minimalist’s story was very heartwarming as they went from corporate workers to fulfilled authors. It is crazy how they went from talking in front of two people about their book to being live on The Today Show. Josh Milburn, one of the minimalists, talks about how minimalism illustrates how you can live more deliberately with less. This is truly inspirational as they both look extremely content with the lives they are living with less. This goes to show you don’t need to have everything in the world in order to be happy. From an environmental standpoint, minimalism is definitely a meaningful option, however, I do not believe it is viable for everyone. After watching the two short films, I was shocked to learn that $150 billion are spent to embed consumer messages in every consumer space. It is scary to think that our phones have the capability to listen to us and provide targeted ads on social media platforms like Instagram, all in the hope that we will buy something. It was also interesting to hear about how materialistic values also affect our relationships with people as well as our care for the planet. The more materialistic we are the more selfish we are and we care less about our environment. Even though these are terrible consequences we find ourselves buying more in hopes to feel fulfilled. Implementing and promoting intrinsic values benefits not only ourselves but our communities and our environment.

One clip from the documentary “Minimalism” especially stood out to me – LifeEdited shows how they can convert a small, compact space into a place that satisfies all of the basic living necessities in a pretty luxurious manner. I was shocked when I saw how the company was able to fit in a bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, guest bedroom, and even a couple couches in a room that is probably not too much bigger than my room in college. This got me thinking – we as society are always looking to expand, always looking to buy more, always looking to own bigger and better thing. However, do we really need to? If we are not really using the things that we already have, what is the point of trying to have more? This leads me into another interesting study from the documentary that states that according to heat maps of houses, average Americans using only 40% of their entire house. However what is even more shocking is that the storage industry in the United States is a 2.2 billion dollar industry. On one hand, we see that people are not even using half of the space and belongings that they have, yet they feel the need to buy more. In fact, they have to buy so much more that they need extra space to put all of their stuff. This phenomena made me strongly consider the minimalist lifestyle. Instead of trying to constantly to have more things, maybe it is more beneficial to live a lifestyle with simple necessities. This does not necessarily mean to starve yourself of basic luxuries, but instead just focus on what satisfies your basic needs instead of constantly trying to fulfill your desires. This, as seen in the documentary, can lead to a better peace of mind.

<p>
I think it’s definitely possible to get people on board with minimalism. However, just like climate change, it’s going to take time to get people to change their lifestyle habits and world views. 
<br><br>
In another one of my classes, we addressed how humanity has been living in a “throw-away” society. To elaborate, rather than having one item for a long time and creating a deeper connection to it, we are supplementing it with multiple singe use items that are only used for a brief period of time. This made me realize how far from our basic needs humanity has come. 
<br><br>
A lot of this materialism has to do with the rapid acceleration of the industrial revolution and how it still affects us today. We’ve adapted to the fast pace lifestyle, and with that, fast goods are needed. 
<br><br>
However, I’ve noticed that more and more generations are beginning to realize that less is better. Especially in the world of fashion. Fast fashion and fast fashion brands are now seen as a kind of sin, whereas sustainable clothing and shopping is in (and very fun!). 
<br><br>
So yes, I believe collective minimalism is possible, but many people don’t know where to start. Perhaps content creation that’s informative on how to integrate minimalism into our daily lives and how to eliminate the excessive luxuries in life?

This film shows the minimalism which is about having less things. Though the film still touched on the environmental impact of excessive consumerism, it also talks about the happiness the minimalism lifestyle brings to oneself and those people around them. This film effectively convey the idea that minimalism is a beneficial way control people’s consuming desire and have a happier and satisfying spiritual world. And it also successfully advocated people not to consume blindly but to follow the minimalism lifestyle.
<br><br>
I felt confused first since i heard of this concept for the first time and i have no idea how this will related to the environment and a person’s spiritual life and i am also confused about how this will beneficial to people and environment. Watching this film i gradually understand how the minimalism beneficial since this film displays some examples of people who follow minimalism and they are actually experiencing happier and healthier lives than before. I was the kind of consumer who love buying new and cheap stuff. For example, i always buy new fast fashion clothes. After i tired of those clothes, i will discard those clothes and buy more new clothes as those last fashion clothes always have latest style and they are not expensive. Also, i love buying latest products like new electronic device. This is because i always believe latest products are better to use and it made me feel satisfying. However, watching this film make me change my attitudes. I realize that such a small change in my lifestyle can help making the world better. And it is really unnecessary to own excess and useless stuff. This will probably make me feeling messy. So, i decided to try to follow the minimalism lifestyle and make change like buying fewer clothes and reduce buying unnecessary products.
</p><hr>


<p>
To be honest, I consider myself a consumerist, and I can’t imagine myself living in the minimalist way that talked in the film. However, I’ve heard the idea since I was in middle school or even earlier. Personally, I probably will never be able to throw everything I don’t really need out of my house because I tried when I graduated from high school and moved out of my dorm; I ended up with fifteen medium size cardboard boxes filled with my stuff. I admire these minimalists because I know how hard it is to keep us from the desire of purchasing new things, especially for people like me, who take shopping as a habit. I’m currently struggling with the consequence brought by consumerism: I bought too many eyeshadow palettes in a short time but soon realized that it’s impossible for me to use all of them, and I also found that some of these palettes look exactly on my eyelids. Due to my personal experience, I would say that everyone should at least try to live in the minimalism way, because it may be an effective way to reduce waste and save resources. I don’t think it’s going to work for every single one of us, but I agree that it’s a better lifestyle compared to consumerism.

<p>
I already watched Minimalism, so this comment pertains to the two youtube videos. The two videos effectively highlight the need for social change (and provides some examples of it's success). The first video, "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" and the second video "The High Price of Materialism" explain that while the American mentality is to boost the economy by increasing spending and production there is a multitude of alternatives that will not only positively effect the economy, but will simultaneously boost the overall moral of workers. This is important because the economy may seem like a bunch of numbers and calculations, but at the end of the day economics is the analysis of people. If the people are unhappy there is no use having a thriving system, when the rest of the world feels as though it is deteriorating (mentally and physically). Thus, the focus should draw away from material things and towards having what is needed to survive. When humans are happy, the earth benefits significantly as well.

Watching the documentary “Minimalism” was not only eye-opening it really probed me towards self-reflection on the way in which I live my life, and the manner in which I spend my money. I felt almost ashamed in myself being able to empathize or see myself as part of the overindulgent social climate. MInimalism tackles how the consumerist nature of society today has governed over our lives, not only financially, but also socially and mentally, and how the life of “Minimalism” is a fulfilling and intelligent manner in which we would be able to live our lives in a sustainable, but practical way. When I first read the title “Minimalism” I thought everyone in the documentary was going to be like the guy that carried everything in his two backpacks, did not have a permanent house and just kept going from one place to another for finite periods of time. But the documentary actually showed that minimalism is not about that, rather elucidates that you should buy only what you NEED rather than what you think you want- in that moment until you get bored and want the newer, techier version-. I will discuss below some of the most interesting things the documentary tackled, In my opinion. 
<br><br>
The assertion that we are “Living our lives depending on the space we’ve got, rather than creating our space to fit our lives” resonated with me conspicuously. It’s true that when you get a loan of $500,000, the first instinctual thought that runs through your head is how big or how great of a house you can get with this amount of money. Rather than thinking logically about the space that you actually need and would use in a productive way. For example, I would want a huge nice decked out kitchen, even if I know that I probably will not be cooking- because I suck at cooking- and therefore I really don’t need it!!
<br><br>
I thought it was really interesting how we used to go through roughly 2 seasons a year, you had your winter and your summer clothes and that was about it. But now, we cycle through 52 seasons per year!! That is insane 52 cycles means that a new edition or new style comes out every single week!! Imagine having to spend on a few new items every single week in order to try and keep up with the current trends being advertized by big media outlets. That is not only extremely wasteful in terms of time, effort and of course economic resources, it is also a huge financial burden on the consumer! What happened to the significance of the basic economic problem- “SCARCE RESOURCES!” 
<br><br>
“Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns,” this phrase was really impactful because I never looked at it like this, but when I reflected over our society and our societal norms, this notion was extremely correct. For example, just the fact that we have TV shows like the Kardashians, like MTV cribs that are basically based around flaunting one’s wealth and showing how big and glamorous their houses are, how many cars they own, how big their closet is it not only irrelevant in my opinion but it instills in the children of this generation that that is what success looks like. Success becomes more about what you own rather than what you do with the money that you work for. Why is Greta Thunberg and other climate activists not as popular as the Kardashians?
</p><hr>


<p>
It’s a time when materialism and consumerism take over people’s heads including mine. People continue to consume, buying more and buying bigger, to try to fill the void inside. But the thing is, we can never fulfill our hunger. It’s like we’re always “hunting”, like what the film says at the beginning. This film introduces a new idea of living-minimalism. Minimalism means buying less and using less-only buying and using those that are necessary according to the film. I think the film is effective at conveying this message. The two authors of the book Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life, Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus really show us their way of living. According to them, living in a minimalistic way can bring your life and the society more colors. People simply have less to worry about and in the meantime have more time to spare for more meaningful things.

One of my favorite things about minimalism is how it made those tiny houses seem so appealing. Prior to watching this documentary, the image I had of small, minimalist homes were things like poorly maintained trailers and things like that. I was happy to see that a small home can be maintained in a manner that makes them very much appealing and not so claustrophobic. While environmental concerns are not the primary motive for the production of the documentary, we've discussed in class that many of the environmental challenges we must overcome are not directly solvable. Instead, a fundamental revamping of our idea of successful living is what will have some of the most profound impact on our carbon footprints. This is true from the multiple angles this can be viewed from. Economically, a reduction in demand for the various unnecessary good we buy means less production and therefore less pollution. This effect in multiple markets will have a staggering impact on the rate at which we pollute. The market will not impose restrictions based on the needs of our environment.  We need to live the lives we preach and force the market to respond to what it listens to: consumer demand. We must demand less!
</p><hr>


<p>
To be honest, the film “Minimalism” is so much more interesting and inspiring than any other films I’ve watched in this course. The case of the two minimalists appeared in the film made me think about my life currently. My surroundings are so complicated that I am so easily distracted by no matter people or things. I live in the 20th century where people pursue happiness and satisfaction by having so many luxuries and accessories around them. We think this is what we want for our lives, hoping for a better and grandeur life living in a huge house with fancy furniture in the future. Yet, minimalism is the idea of having the least belongings. From my perspective, we can pursue happiness and luxury. But more importantly, we should be grateful for what we have and be generous to others. As long as we have contentment, we will know what’s the best solution to the problem is––– getting closer to become a minimalist.

I agree with Ken that we should at least try to be minimalists. I know that it will not be easy, because it's difficult to give up things that we have been socialized to believe that we need and are vital to our existence. We are also so used to having a surplus and minimalism is hard to fathom. While watching this film, it did have me questioning what things I currently own that spark joy, and to tell you the truth, I came to the realization that a lot of what I own is just surplus. In the documentary, they mention how people are miserable because of an excess of choices, we have become overwhelmed with trying to fill a void with materials. Another interesting thing brought up in the film is, how humans are wired to be dissatisfied; we are constantly searching for happiness and for the illusion of what we think our lives are meant to look like. Through advertising, we are sold the idea that we need these things to be happy and feel successful. It's crazy how ads are even aimed at children and the products being advertised are junk. We are so used to being sold these toxic ideas that we do not even realize how it is negatively impacting us. For example what is being advertised to children are primarily unhealthy foods (kids have no concept of the right foods to eat) and gendered toys/products. Through minimalism, it is having us question whether products bring value into our lives, and if it does not then we need to get rid of it. They also emphasis the importance of real life connections and staying present in the moment with loved ones. Something that was said in the film that really stood out to me was, "human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns". I hope that the concept of success changes soon, because the current value of success is ruining the planet and is not producing happy people, but people with money who buy products to fill the voids they feel from being overworked.
</p><hr>



<p>
Although the film didn’t address the correlation between minimalism and climate change too much, it was still an interesting documentary that I’m glad was assigned for this class. We like to think that in the United States we are free, but this alternative version of the American Dream and success have trapped us. Before, the American Dream was this idea of opportunity and this idea that if you work hard enough you can be successful. But since there was no clear definition of what success in this situation was, we made successful mean having a lot of money and owning many materialistic items. This idea of the American Dream has limited up from our path in life. We have this idea that there’s only one path to life, but this is wrong. This documentary does a good job at explaining why having a lot of money and having a lot of things doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be happy. There was a man, Ryan, in the film that was dealing with a great deal of sadness. He mentioned how he had this gaping void and tried to fill the gaping void with stuff, with consumer purchases. Essentially, he was trying to buy himself happiness, but happiness is not a consumer product, therefore it cannot be bought. We’re lured into this state of dissatisfaction by technology, ads, and social media. It’s an illusion they try to trap us in that these luxuries are necessities, but that there will always be more and more “necessities,” more and more things we “need.” It’s crazy because when Josh read the passage in his book about all the things he would “need” in his house, I’ve had that same mentality when it comes to packing for a trip. Even when I came to move from the bay area to college here in Santa Barbara, I kept asking myself what else do I need. In order to change these unhealthy habits, we must first not seem them as necessities. Other than Ryan, families also try to fill voids up with items. A study showed that a family of 4 with a big house only used about 40% of their house, so they fill the other 60% with stuff. Sometimes this void isn’t emotions, but literal and physical space that exists. 
<br><br>
Minimalism is all about the idea that each item you own brings you a sense of joy. If an item doesn’t bring us joy, why would we be so defensive about keeping it? I think it’s because of the what ifs situations that play in our head. A person might be hesitant about getting rid of an old video game, because they think what if I want to play it again, it’s the idea of that want never being a possibility again that frightens us into this state of in a way hoarding all these unnecessary items. But the truth is even if we never own the item again, it doesn't mean the experience will never happen again. For instance, a friend might own the same game and you could play with them. I like the example that’s similar to this scenario that’s given within the film. This woman had an event to go to and instead of buying a new dress, she asked her friends if she could borrow one of theirs. Just because the woman never owned that type of dress, doesn’t mean she never got to experience wearing a dress of that type.
<br><br>
It’s crazy to me the lengths industries will go to make money. Before watching this video, I knew that Louis Vuitton didn’t sell its products for low prices, so instead, they take the unsold products and burn them. I thought maybe it was just Louis Vuitton that was like this, but after watching this documentary, I realized it isn’t. Other big fashion companies have destroyed their clothes and items. All the fossil fuels used to create those products were now absolutely for nothing.
</p><hr>


<p>
In the documentary Minimalism: A Documentary About Important Things, one line that caught my attention was "love people and use things because the opposite never works." This resonated with me because I feel that the opposite is the mentality that drives the people of the first world. It is all I have seen growing up and has become a habit in me as well. It is a toxic idea but in a world where items have so much value socially and monetarily it is hard to ignore it. People become a second priority behind money and that is detrimental in so many aspects. This greed that has been embedded into our world has hindered our happiness, relationships, and environment. 
<br><br>
I do feel that people need to change or make an effort to change to a minimalistic lifestyle and it is not that difficult to do so. Just by evaluating what is important to you and getting rid of all the rest can introduce a person to new freedoms, from unneeded stress, compulsory consumerism, and a disconnection from people. In addition to living a healthier lifestyle, making this change will decrease a person's carbon footprint and help the environment. This idea is one of the driving forces of humans destroying the climate. If we were to give up our overly lavish lifestyles then there would be less emission made from producing these items and powering these items. The first world is run by love for products and the stress that comes with trying to attain things and that is not how people should be living their lives.
</p><hr>


<p>
Minimalism is the privileged man's immediate reaction to consumerism. I agree with what Ken said in this video, minimalism is a first-world solution to a first-world problem. That is immediately what I thought when watching this film. I thought: "oh, these are upper-middle class individuals that have sit-down desk jobs and go home to a white picket fence every day." Boooor-ing!!! What the hell do they do for hobbies? Surf the internet, since a laptop seems to be the only entertaining thing they own? I, for example, am a musician and an artist. I've always joked that artists are hoarders, and to some extent that is true. We need a lot of stuff to do what makes us happy (such as art supplies and instruments). Now, I don't necessarily think the point of that movie was to get us to throw away our hobbies, but that sure is what it felt like. For someone who is not an artist (for example), it might be easy to separate happiness from objects. But it is just not that simple. It is the interaction between me and that object that does in fact bring me happiness in most times where I can not stand contact with another human. If you took my guitar away from me I would probably throw a fit. Is that a result of consumerism? Is that a result of living in America? I'm not sure. I do think, however, that I could do without that cool-looking guitar strap when I already have one, or that fancy pedalboard, or (sigh- i know) another guitar.
<br><br>
P.S. this movie did have some very smart points, I just chose to expand on the one that annoyed me because that's always more fun :^) I do think it is smart that we all do what we can. I don't think everyone will be living in tiny houses anytime soon, but it is not that hard to donate the items that you don't use or wear anymore to a thrift store.
</p><hr>


<p>
“You’re successful” Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Millburn had worked for the same corporation for many years yet one was happy. I found it interesting to hear that Nicodemus had everything yet was still miserable. I personally don’t believe in “Money can’t buy happiness” but I feel as if both Nicodemus and Millburn would. The difference between the two was minimalism. Variety is something that leads to excess stuff. The film shows Millburn’s home and everything is almost clear. There’s very little stuff that fills the space, making his property look bigger. I think minimalism is something that can significantly change the consumer market. Everyone wants to upgrade to something bigger but minimalism can give that illusion. Have a minimalistic mentality means asking yourself “Does this add value to my life?” then being willing to let it go. I see how becoming a minimalist changed their lives to be happier. When cleaning your room, you feel better once you’ve finished. “That’s just a template, it’s not the template.” It’s crazy to me how applicable minimalism is to all types of situations. Whether it’s physical objects, wardrobe, or even phone storage, there is room to minimize. It’s hard to think of all the changes you’d have to make in becoming a minimalist. Fighting those tendencies of buying or getting the next new thing. It could be difficult but there are so many pros to that kind of lifestyle. Like Ken said, I don't think it'd be enough for the environment."

I think the most striking aspect of this film was how jarring it was. Not only in the way it forces us to rethink our culture and influences, but in that it makes us rethink our whole lives. The idea of living in the way this documentary (and other on the topic I’ve seen) suggests is mind boggling. I watch with shock and think “no way could I do that”. I’m Not an Uber materialistic person. I like my tidy shelf of Knick knacks And I own a couple more books than I probably should but for the most part I’m pretty spartan when it comes to owning useless things. But the idea of forgoing objects like ziplock bags, disposable tissues, ANY packaged foods is incomprehensible. What would I do without the three pillows on my bed? Or all the soft coats I own and love even though I only need one? The real effect of this documentary is less the information it imparts (which is baffling in another way) buy in the way it forces every single watcher to complete reasses themselves and what they really NEED. This week I’m going to try and challenge myself to use as little as I can. Wear as little variation in clothing, use items the least amount, not buy new things, eat the food I have etc. I’m interested in seeing just how drastic a life change I can make in the future. Fascinating documentary.

The film “Minimalism: a Documentary About the Important Things” was interesting to watch as someone who does indulge in over consumerism and then feels the need to continue to hold onto the items because I know I ought to use them if I bought them. While I do not think I will necessarily take minimalism to the level that Colin Wright has (where all of his belongings fit in two bags) I would like to go through my belongings and abandon the items that I do not necessarily use. 
<br><br>
 What I found most interesting about the individuals the documentary followed was the peace they found in their new lives. How the simplicity of knowing exactly what one needs and having only what is necessary to fulfill those needs allowed them to focus on more important matters. Before watching the documentary I rarely thought of how my wanting a new product typically came from its novelty, or the fact that others had one and therefore I needed one to be considered “cool” or up to date, when in reality, other people don’t actually care what the average person has. I was particularly amused by the results of the 333 (perhaps there are more 3s?) challenge as many of the individuals who embarked on it assumed others would notice and were surprised to find that no one commented on their repeated outfits.
<br><br>
 Overall, this documentary inspired me to think more about what makes me happy over what I think will make others view me in a positive light. What is the point of keeping up with expectations in society if you are miserable.

I feel like this film made living a minimalist life-style as if it was such an easy thing to do. Yes this film makes it seem so calming and peaceful, by only living on what you need and know what you have will serve a purpose, but most people aren’t always able to give up most of their possessions. And if they do, it’s usually such a slow process of “getting rid of things.” I have a mixed view on seeing whether or not minimalism is viable because I’ve grown up not having much, so by having money now that my father was making a livable income, spending it on items was a way for us to show off to others that we did have money and we are living a lavish lifestyle. It’s a way to show that we worked hard for our money and deserve to spend it the way we pleased. I also can say that I may not take things to the extreme as Wright, but I will incorporate some things when I do consider buying something, such as asking myself If I indeed really need this and what use will it serve me, is it durable, and will it harm the environment?

This film, “Minimalism,” really stood out to me because it speaks on more than just the environment, but on our society as a whole. The reason that minimalism is not as widely accepted as it could be is because of the consumerist society we live in that is fueled by capitalism and the desire forced upon us for materialistic wealth. Recently, in one of my other classes, FEM 80, I read about how our society breaks us down and builds insecurities in us practically from birth, and we are then advertised products that will “fix” these insecurities to fuel our desire to be accepted by society and fit what is seen as the norm. We are taught that the accumulation of wealth will translate into happiness, and thus we must constantly strive to purchase more and more products that, in reality, have little impact on our long-term well-being. I appreciate the work that Ryan and Josh, or The Minimalists, as they call themselves, do in order to spread awareness on the idea that material wealth does not equate to happiness. In fact, the constant strive for more money and more possessions makes us far more unhappy, which is one of the central reasons so many people are plagued with mental health issues and feelings of inadequacy in regards to their personal success. These systems in our society put us into a constant cycle of working tirelessly to buy more things, not feeling the expected satisfaction of owning more objects, and working more, only to benefit the most wealthy people in our society. In order for us to break this cycle, we must dismantle these systems and understand that we do not have to follow the “script,” as Ken puts it. It is clear that our well-being as a society does not benefit from consumerism, and as the climate crisis has worsened, it is obvious that the environment does not benefit either. We can not continue to damage our planet for our own selfish desires, as it obviously doesn’t make anyone happy or positively benefit people to trap themselves in the cycle of capitalism. In order for this change to occur, I believe we must all try to practice a minimalist lifestyle in some way. I don’t think everyone necessarily has to throw away everything they own or stop purchasing new items, but this should be done to some extent. For example, in recent months, I have decided to educate myself more on fast fashion, as I would often spend money on clothes to reward myself or give myself temporary happiness by buying something new. I have realized, however, how detrimental the fashion industry is to our environment, and have focused on instead thrifting, buying used clothes, or buying higher quality clothing that I know will last longer. I encourage everyone to practice minimalism in some way, as I think it teaches us to undo the cycle and release the societal pressures we have to buy more than what we truly need in order to feel successful.

I had vaguely heard of the minimalist movement before and thought it meant giving up all of your possessions and essentially living a nomadic life free of any material objects. It was interesting this idea disproved in the documentary, which instead showcased many different approaches to minimalism. One question I had always had was how people with kids could afford to be minimalist and this question was answered when I saw how minimalist parents still bought toys for their children and let them have fun, while still carefully considering each purchase they made. The different situations that the people found themselves in that still allowed for a minimalist lifestyle made me more able to believe that everyday people could be minimalist. 
<br><br>
However, I still do not know how an entire society could be made to behave this way. While I agree that the American Dream is inherently flawed in that it prioritizes material goods, it is this dream that formed the foundation of America, a country of dreamers. I wonder what can be said or done to convince an entire country to change their way of life. If it was possible, I think it would be a good thing overall. Reducing the needs for consumer goods would lower the United States' level of carbon emissions and hopefully make for a happier population, especially if coupled with a lower amount of hours worked per week as Ken said in the video. I have hope that in an effort to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, people can be inspired to at least reduce the amount they consume. While I doubt the entire country could all transition to minimalism, I hope that people could be convinced to reduce the amount they buy by a small amount, which on a large scale would make a big difference.

Minimalism. When you think about it, it’s quite an interesting concept. In today’s society,we’ve been bred to always have the newest, nicest, most “in fashion” items available. This doesn’t even apply strictly to clothes, but to things such as phones and cars to name a few. This consumerist culture has been instilled within our everyday lives, and this film does a great job deconstructing the drawbacks to this mindset. It’s easy to become caught up in having the nicest things all the time, and to be quite frank it’s mentally unhealthy. You’re constantly in competition with those around you, and you begin to feel a sense of inadequacy when the items you have aren’t up to par with those around you. In reality though, these items are meaningless. They don’t have any special significance, they won’t improve your quality of life vastly in the long run. As a nation, we have simply been caught up in the consumerist wave that has swept through America. 
<br><br>
The solution to the issue as discussed in this film is to simply consume less. As I mentioned before, none of this “stuff” is really necessary for survival. On top of that, the environmental impact is simply not worth the consumption. Every day, we consume more and more, whether it be food or clothes, and much of the time we don't need it. By making the pact to consume less, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and lessen the waste our planet crates each and every day. To be clear, minimalism isn’t necessarily stressing the concept of living with only the absolute necessities, but rather emphasizing the idea that luxury items aren’t needed to make happy, and that buying just enough to maintain comfortability is enough to make your own positive impact in today’s climate.

Just this morning I was talking with a friend who stated that when she was feeling down, she would often shop to try and feel better. This made me think because I, like my friend and so many others, do the same thing. If I’m feeling sad, I’ll go buy myself new things. This, in a way, is a distraction. I’m assuming that having these material objects will make me happier. That new clothes or new makeup can fix or distract me. Even when I’m not upset, I find that I’m constantly looking forward to my next purchase and the amount of joy I get from having something new is frightening. 
<br><br>
Something from the Buddhist ideology that I truly believe is that you cannot be happy unless you let go of worldly possessions and stop wanting for things. The craving for these materialistic items is simply a distraction. It’s a distraction from trying to find true, lasting contentment. Buying and having things does not satisfy the hunger for them, all it does is increase the want. This constant want only breeds more discontentment and therefore a terrible cycle begins. As “Minimalism” states, if you just work in order to buy more things because it is ingrained in your way of life to want for materialistic possessions, life will be very unfulfilling. Making the effort to try and live a more minimalistic life and focus on lasting, true contentment will not only better the earth by reducing your footprint, but will also better the soul.

In the first few minutes of the film, the topics discussed already hit close to home. As Americans, we all have an ideal life that we think we want. The intent of advertisements is almost malicious, in making us believe that we want certain things with clever marketing tactics. What really awed me was the Wall Street Broker’s story. As of now, I could not fathom refusing a job promotion like that  but that makes me realize that different people have different priorities. Some people are able to live a meaningful life with less. I don’t think I can live a life with that little, but I have a huge amount of respect for the people that do. It was inspiring learning the stories of people living minimalist lives. At one point, living in a tiny home crossed my mind. These people are living proof that you don’t need material goods to be happy. It’s common knowledge that today’s society is too materialistic. We always want the newest and most expensive things, but ultimately the happiness that comes with buying new things is only temporary. I find it disgusting how companies market senseless junk to young, and impressionable children. By exposing children to these advertisements at such a young age sets them on an inevitable path of materialism. As a society, I think we should all encourage each other to appreciate what we have and each other.

The minimalist lifestyle is very interesting to me. It is difficult because there is the pull of fancy cars and lots of fun clothes and things that seem to bring happiness, then cutting down on material good which, whenever I have actually done this has brought me happiness. Recently I spent a few months traveling around and living out of a 45 liter backpack. All my belongings fit into that backpack. At first it was difficult, however after a week or so, I got used to it and it became easier. I didn't worry much about what I was going to wear because I only had a few options, and usually the weather paired with whatever I was going to do dictated what I should wear. I had one book and when I was down I'd trade with someone for  a new book. I got much more use out of each of my belongings. When I got back I was extremely overwhelmed by my full closet and car and excess of everything. I'm now settled in and used to this lifestyle again, but the 5 months that I lived out of a backpack were very eye opening. Although I wouldn't want to do that for the rest of my life, like one man in the documentary, I would like to cut down on my belongings a lot, which I have been trying to do recently.
<br><br>
And Time! We have so little time. In life, and especially if we spend our lives working. I love the thought of working less and living more.
<br><br>
I also find it interesting that so many of the people interviewed in this movie were in finance and economics. You gotta see all the money to see you don't want it I guess.
</p><hr>


<p>
The one sentence from those two short videos gets the point of how to protect environment, said that “We can't just trade one problem off for another”. Like if I decide to ride a bicycle in order to reduce my carbon footprint instead of car, it does not mean that I actually reduce my footprint because making bicycle is also going to cause the carbon emission. So, from my perspective, the minimalism is a really, compared to other solutions, viable way to solve the environment pollution. However, I think it will be extremely difficult to make everyone living in that ideal life style for some rich people. Even though they are feeling depressed and anxiety about the life they have, I do not they are willing to give up their life style that easily. Not mention some of them earned money by damaging the environment. I can tell that minimalism is effective if people will follow the “utopian” so as simple life style, it gonna be a tough and long time for everyone to do so. But I still have some faith about that, which can be one of my little dreams I wish to happen.

Building a culture around minimalism is already happening. As was evident from the documentary "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", downsizing is trendy. However, I don't really see the minimalism portrayed in this film as strictly downsizing all aspects of your life. I think it is a way for people to reevaluate what material pocessions they really need, and recognizing that having unnecessary stuff just creates more stress.
<br><br>
But what if an entire society decides to be minimalist, short-cutting personal choice? You get something like the Soviet Union. Being "minimalist" not by personal choice is a recipe for disaster. I definitely see minimalist culture becoming more relevant, but I don't know about the economic and political change. I think the personal choice is what makes minimalism meaningful to those that practice it today.

I really like the portion when the documentary talks about cell phones. I deleted my Instagram after watching it. Actually, I wanted to do it a long time ago, but the fact that everyone is using it made me hesitate. Sometimes I hate it when I am literally just holding my phone. It can create so many intangible noises just with the apps I install on my phones, not to mention all the push notifications and emails and messages.  I guess the minimalism can not only apply to the physical objects but also these pieces of flooded information. The noise can be anywhere today, and we don't even think about the problems with it. We adapt to the novelty quickly, which creates more noise constantly. We don't realize the fact that we are trapped. The faster and faster speed of consumption is toxic, whether it's about actual stuff or media. 
<br><br>
In terms of materialism, it is just ridiculous that now everything is now ranked which implies the different level of success Thus we all aim for the best high school, best university, best company, best city to live, best apartment, best car, best outfit, best photo, best outcome...but if we aren't able to get those best things, we are then dissatisfied and unhappy, and then trying harder and harder to get there. There is definitely a social comparison amplified through all those rankings and social media platforms. We need more people to realize that this is not healthy.

As a film overall I find it to be successful in carrying its message in a digestible way, and truthfully I have always found minimalism to be something that interests me. I myself am OCD so I could see how living a minimalist life would take a huge amount of stress off my shoulders. It allows for more time to be focused on people and less on objects, and of course there are the environmental benefits to minimalism which makes it even more appealing. After hearing their message I was convinced that if more people transitioned to this type of sustainable life things would be much better in regards to climate change. I truly think fighting consumerist ideals are a pivotal point in fighting environmental change and negative policy.
<br><br>
Personally here’s my qualms though… I am a creative person. Along with that I am very sentimental, and living a life like this just seems a little depressing. Both my parents are furniture designers so I've been raised to live in an expressive household- as well as enjoy design and a lifestyle like this is not conducive to that. These guys just lived in bare houses, there was no personality in anything… I couldn’t live like that. It just doesn't seem enjoyable or beneficial to me. What's the point in having a whole house and putting one table and chair in it if you are already taking up the space? Downsize. Why did they get rid of their photos? This all felt so unnecessary to me, and I value all these things.. And I do not see that as bad. I don't know, i agree with the concept of living a minimal life which i feel like i already do but this was too much to me. I can't help but agree with the guy that said this feels like a first world solution to a first word problem, it totally is. Also, these guys were VERY hug hungry, the amount of times they talked about being ”huggers” was insanity. They did more hugging in the film then they did showing how to live a minimal life realistically. I dont see anything wrong with expression, i just cannot get on board with how bland this lifestyle would be but i can respect the broad idea behind it.

I really liked the point Ken added at the end about larger systematic change. We hold the things we love so dearly because it is all we have, we slave to allow ourselves the means to live and eat, and indulge in our luxuries because it's the unfound sense that is missing within our lives. In an earlier comment on one of Ken's videos, I was very critical of the idea of a mass social adjustment, unable to think of anything outside the current system. Though I do still think this would be a rather hard thing to accomplish, major cultural changes may provide the spark necessary to provoke quick stable change. The film did an amazing job of normalizing a foreign perspective of life as we know it. It is challenging, again, to think outside of what you know is true, there is much to be learned from the sacrifices made by others.

The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" truly gave me an insight into what it means to be a minimalist. Prior to watching this film, I had a general idea about the characteristics of a minimalist, typically someone driven by environmental motivations with very little interest in consuming unnecessary materialistic items. I was fascinated by the backgrounds of the people featured in this film. For example, the two main people featured in this movie both left successful careers to pursue a minimalist lifestyle. Their reasoning for doing so was mainly because they found that their purchases of expensive goods didn't necessarily help them with troubles in their life involving fulfillment and happiness.  I thought it was really inspiring to see people coming from a place of accessibility and high economic standing to pursue this lifestyle, because it was proof to me that it is possible to let go of unnecessary items and goods. I was also surprised to see families and couples also practicing minimalist lifestyles. What I enjoyed about this film is that it didn't feature people who practiced extreme lifestyles which would seem unattainable. Instead, the film features people who used practical methods in their everyday life to consume less and therefore leave a smaller carbon footprint on the planet. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who would want to learn more about how easy it can be to reduce consumer purchases.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About Important Things” was a very interesting and effective film, especially while following up our introduction to the topic through Thoreau’s “Walden”. It was very interesting to watch and learn about minimalism in its application in our society today, and I doubly intrigued because one of my closest friends recently brought up how they had been listening to a minimalist podcast and wanted to start implementing certain practices into their own routine. The overarching reasoning behind her interest in the minimalism mainly involved its positive potential impact on mental health and stability; mainly through eliminating many of the things in our lives that give us unintended/unwarranted stress, pressure, anxiety, and fear (social media, internet, cellular phones, etc.). In different, and subtle ways, parts of minimalism have caught the attention of my generation (well at least for a lot of people who I know), through cutting off social media. One of my closest friends has had all of his social media platforms deleted and removed from the home page of his phone. We recently spoke about how everyone knows/feels the peculiar anxiety that consistent social media force onto us [less for some and more powerfully for others] and he told me that removing himself from the middle of it all allowed him to recognize its pitfalls and how he was going to control it going forward. 
<br><br> 
Millburn and Nicodemu show us how living out minimalist and simplistic practices can allow individuals to fill the void of satisfaction that we have been conditioned to search for in so many other things (consumerism, luxury, etc.). Although many of us most likely won’t transform every aspect of our lives to minimalism, I think its a really good thing that many of us apply minimalism in our own ways, and have learned to recognize and give up certain things that we have become so accustomed to. Exhibiting and spreading how minimalism and environmentalism are intertwined is an added bonus to the benefits it reaps for the individuals’ health and happiness. Lastly, I really appreciate this film and hope I can take some of its messages and apply it to different aspects of my own life.

In fact, the purpose of minimalism is very simple, but it is difficult to practice, just like human instinctively has an instinct to enter a disordered state, eat more high-calorie things, have more items, and emotional and thinking fall into chaos. . In this sense, I think that minimalism is not only anti-consumerism megatrend, but also anti-popular, so it will only be popular in a small area or become a subculture. Therefore, anyone who wants to enter or is practicing minimalism has a very strong desire to shop up or enter the bottleneck period. I think it is normal because human nature is so. Especially in today's mobile network era, everyone is overwhelmed by information. I think the only way to combat this nature is to continuously strengthen this rational cognition, join groups, and inspire each other.
<br><br>
The main line of this documentary is also very simple. It follows two Ryan and Joshua who promoted minimalist books and ideas on tour tours throughout the United States. Of course, both of them are minimalists. Among them, Ryan was originally a salesman who sold mobile phones. Joshua is a successful middle management. They have analyzed the problems of their native family. Joshua began to think about herself and her property because she was ill and passed away because she had not worked around the clock to get a raise. And people's relationships with minimalism.
<br><br>
The film mentions many industries, including real estate, fast fashion, furniture, children's related and so on. It points out the essence of consumerism: the social value (such as fashion) imposed on the goods by society has far exceeded the use value of the goods, and ordinary consumers are implanted into their own needs by mingxing and companies through various means and media. What, and what you get through intemperate shopping is not what you really want, so you will never be satisfied.

While watching the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," it wasn't as surprising hearing the things they mentioned about materialism and happiness. However, one moment in the film that was unbelievable to me was when footage was shown of a women during Black Friday snatching a box from a child and fighting with their mother. It showed me the extent people are so attached to their things, to the point where they seem to lose their humanity. Those Black Friday videos just showed how people would fight one another in order to get a "good" deal on an item. Their carts would be filled with piles of stuff, but at the end of the day what's the purpose of buying 3 boxes of the same thing? Seeing some of these toxic shopping habits in the film reminded me of myself at times too. There have been times where I'm stressed and I have the urge to go do some retail therapy. I end up buying items, such as clothes, thinking they will magically relieve my stress and make me happy. However, now that I look back I don't even wear most of my clothes that I've bought. I wear the same clothing items each week. The film has greatly inspired me to shrink my own closet to items that I know I will consistently wear and bring me happiness, because what is the point of having clothes that don't make me feel good about myself. It's like when Joshua Millburn told the man named Clyde that minimalism is more about stepping away from compulsory consumption. Often times people think that minimalism means getting rid of all their things, but in reality it just means keeping what makes you feel happy. Not only will it improve your happiness, but have a positive effect on the environment.
</p><hr>


<p>
I personally love this documentations a lot, which doesn't only offer a more environmental friendly life style that has the potential to take over and become the new culture, but also suggest a philosophy that lead to the true peace of mind-minimalism. I especially love the quote "What I love about my life now, is I can be genuine, and there is no manipulations" at the end of the film. 

For a long time I wasn't being honest with myself and my true feelings about what I truly want. I excused myself that I didn't have the time to build and take care of meaningful relationships, then I found myself suffered from anxiety, it results in me isolating myself more, I became afraid of social interactions. The thing I did to fill the void was described exactly as the film did: I consumed more and more things that I don't need, they are either material made in real life or can be accessed virtually such as video games. Then I trapped myself in to a cycle of seeking meaningless stimulants that will give me dopamine to satisfy my additions. The reason behind it is a mindset that was sick, caused by a culture that is also sick.



Now I realized the whole society is just suffering from the same mental illness, the industries and our culture that promotes consuming was only taking advantages of what people already are, and reinforced the ideas to deliver them to the next generations. The illness will need a cure because the core of the problem is we don't have an earth with infinite resource for us to consume. We took and are still taking all the unnecessary, the things we want. We are no better than cancer cells to a human body, only not as fatal as cancer to Earth. Like fever, climate changes might just be enough to cause our species to die out, what comes after is only a reset world without human. The film then offer us a solution, a cure to the mental illness. It is not going to easy as additions aren't that easy to be overcame, most characters in the film only chose the path of minimalist as redemption because by chance they were able to realize and "wake up" against peers and culture they live in. But nonetheless this is a great solution for personal and it's definitely something I will be trying. Minimalism should be spread and act just like other solutions we discussed to stop climate changes. And even though it do seem like only upon miracles it will work soon enough to stop the climate changes, we don't have more time to ask and question but to put on more efforts, to save any single bit of chances of overcoming ourselves.

The part that stood out to me the most from the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” was the scene where minimalist Joshua Fields Millburn reads an excerpt from his memoir. In this scene he talks about all the new things he needs for his new apartment like new towels, a new bed, a new couch, etc., etc. At this moment it hit me: This is me. Everything Joshua was reading is what I have been thinking about these past few weeks. I am in the process of signing a lease with my friends right now and like most people, I’m very excited to move into this new place and make it my own. As I was thinking about moving into my new apartment, I thought of a brilliant idea: How nice would it be to have a brand new big TV for the living room?!?! ...right? 
<br><br>
Watching this film, more specifically, watching this scene, is what made me think about stuff in a whole new different way. After watching the film, I no longer want the TV. Part of the reason being because I felt as if the film asked me: Do you NEED this? And I know I don’t, but how nice would it be to have one... right? But I work hard and I deserve this... right? 
<br><br>
I believe that it is this very thinking that is what stops most Westernized capitalist countries from moving beyond the obsession of stuff. To answer your question Ken, “Can we maximize minimalism? Could we actually make this happen? Could we get enough people to go along with it to actually reinvent our materialistic culture?” My answer is yes, as long as we change our relationship and view with stuff (clothes, electronics, cars, etc.) and realize that the excess of materials isn’t helping anyone.
</p><hr>


<p>
“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” was an interesting film and exposed me to a lifestyle that I had heard about but not really examined in full detail. The concept of minimalism in intriguing,  but its serves as more of an answer to consumerism than it does to the climate crisis. They present minimalism in this film as it is the answer to a more organized, what you could call "primitive lifestyle", however it glosses over some of the major drawbacks of the minimalistic lifestyle. The film never really mentions the concept of food consumption. For example, the section of the film focused on "full time traveler", Colin Wright fails to mention how Wright consumes food. Does he eat out for every meal? Does he heat up food? This brings up the question of what is food consumption to a minimalist? 
<br><br>
I do however see the factor of happiness and the role it plays in making people more connected to each other and the environment. When we are caught up in the "hunt" described in the film, people can get lost in the materialistic fog that clouds the mind of the masses to make them consume more. When people consume less, they are actually more full and more willing to understand and address societal issues rather than focus on the individualistic needs. The important things are staying connected which is usually a product of happiness. If minimalism provides happiness, then it can take people out of this fog of consumption and allow them to see their world (especially nature) and help them form an appreciation and desire to save and preserve it.

I completely agree with this analysis--minimalism is not a wholistic approach to resolving the problems of climate change, it is part of an approach to resolving the problems that people can feel with consumerism, but at the end of the day it is not just an approach or a response: its an aesthetic. And inherent in the adoption of a new aesthetic is yet more consumerism: buying more things so it looks better to have less of those new things. Buying a new tiny house in the forest but still keeping a large car. Buying a second, more minimalist house when your urban apartment is perfectly fine.

When I first thought of a minimalist lifestyle, I imagined its psychological benefits. My initial idea of it reminded me of “spring cleaning,” and other things we do as an attempt to declutter our minds. After watching “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” I gained a whole new perspective of the minimalist lifestyle. It portrayed how making changes like getting rid of clutter, reducing spending habits, riding bikes, etc., make tremendous changes to society. Yes, like Joshua’s story, this could be mental, but this lifestyle also brings benefits to our environment. Wanting less makes up for the luxurious lifestyle us Americans have normalized. 
<br><br>
I also think that an extreme minimalist lifestyle isn’t for everybody. It doesn’t mean you cannot have your own personal things, or can’t enjoy some luxuries of life. However, this film showed how cutting back on some of our main habits like driving, or buying excess food can make a huge difference. Personally, these changes are also beneficial financially.
<br><br>
I do see how people feel freer and mentally liberated after switching to this lifestyle. This film inspired me to cut back and get rid of a lot of things I don’t actually need.

I have seen this idea of Minimalism in TV commercials, weirdly, talking about designs of housing and furniture in minimalism. That share some ideas with the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” about freeing people from stress, depression etc. and coincidentally meets my criteria for my future housing: no need to have a big space, just necessities that keeps my life going HAPPILY. In my case, to satisfy my needs is easy. All I ever wanted is electricity and internet, not much beyond that. I thought this was minimalism, until I found out that my criteria probably won't fit in it. It made me questioning myself: am I one of those hypocritical person who thought that I was living a minimalism life but actually not? Probably yes, which I think, at least to me, it is  hard to give up the materialistic culture and dive deep into the minimalism life. As, Ken said, minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem. Then how can we force people who want to but never have experienced materially abundant life to join us in minimizing our consumption for the sake of environment? Again, I am not optimistic about this.

<p>
I think the concept of minimalism itself is an okay way to combat climate change because people really don't need a lot of stuff and most of what they use just takes up space and is never used again. The problem with this is that we are in too deep with consumerism and how we portray ourselves to society to make some actual changes. It is a viable and meaningful option, however I don't see this tactic being adopted by many people, especially those who have been spoiled their whole life by their parents. The fact that there was a drastic increase on money spent towards marketing to kids throughout the years will ultimately make changing more difficult because people want to be good parents and they, "can't get enough of what they don't really want". I thought about this quote throughout the film and I was reminiscing on the times when I was a stubborn kid making my parents buy me a toy because I thought it was cool. A couple of days later it started to collect dust under my bed and I never used it again. I think parents should know when to put their foot down and teach their kids to live a more sustainable life, such as how that family did in the documentary, instead of giving up many of the things you own and completely converting to a whole new lifestyle. I found it interesting that throughout the documentary, Ryan, Joshua and others kept repeating that they were so dissatisfied with their lives and that there was a "void" that prevented them from being happy, so they turned to minimalism. I kept thinking to myself, "How are people okay living like this?" and it made me think of "Normal Bob" from "Spongebob Squarepants" because personally a life like that is really boring to me especially if we were to live in tiny houses like the ones that were shown. I think that a better solution to this would be to keep some of your belongings, yet instead of building houses more wide, they should be built taller which would take up less space as well. Also if the world population was controlled then people such as that guy who gave up his job at the bank when he was promoted, wouldn't have to feel so overwhelmed by constantly having to deal with so many people. They mentioned that their way of living is not at an extreme, yet in the middle, however I do not agree with this at all because it is nice to own things especially multiple pieces of clothing and getting rid of a lot of the things you own is pretty extreme and risky.

I agree, people don’t need so much stuff. I don’t buy anything if I can help it. I hate buying clothes and I hate clutter. Every single thing I own is in my one double room, the size of a walk-in closet. I don’t understand how people accumulate so many things. I grew up in a household that purged everything, and I cannot imagine living my life with things I didn’t want to have, when I could just get rid of them. I also, however, grew up with a general understanding of poverty on a global level, and how it effects the way people relate with goods. I have everything I need, granted, but the many who don’t are solely looking to fulfill this need, not live a life of “thing gluttony”. One issue I have with this documentary, in particular, is that is entirely directed and considers the viewpoint of people who are already comfortable and in the United States. Almost every single person depicted in this documentary is white, the vast majority are men, and they portray the privileged viewpoint of being a white comfortable male in America downsizing because they can, and it makes them feel good about themselves. It doesn’t take into consideration that excessive global poverty is largely in part due to less access to resources, and generally, things. Furthermore, I don’t see the reason we are watching this documentary in this class. I understand the link between consumerism and environmental issues, but this documentary doesn’t attempt to make that connection very heavily.

<p>
I never really learned much about minimalism as a lifestyle before this class. At first it seemed quite overwhelming to make that lifestyle change but watching this documentary really made me realise that the benefits really do outweigh the positives. I never considered how much living in a materialistic world consumes our lifestyle. It’s a never-ending cycle that leaves us wanting more and never being satisfied. So, if we are able to live a lifestyle in which we can really focus on the important things in life, like family and friends, and not constantly be craving the newest items and looking to material items for a temporary state of happiness whilst helping the environment, why not make that switch? But of course, I see how this is easier said than done. We have created such a structure, in which we feel like we must rely on consumerism, we would have to restructure that whole system, which takes time and a lot of determination. I was a little frustrated watching the documentary, because of how much they emphasised that purchasing things will never result in actual satisfaction, and my frustration stemmed from the fact that I find myself often turning to shopping and “things” when I’m having a bad day. It’s frustrating because I don’t know where this habit stemmed from, but I do it more often that I would care to admit. I’ve always known in the back of my mind that I don’t NEED things, but I continue to purchase things. Every time I go home, my mom tells me to clear out my closet and keep aside anything I need to donate, and I always get an uneasy feeling with how many items of clothing I have that I barely even wore. But this documentary has encouraged me to really reflect on my habits, and try to live a more minimalist lifestyle. We have also discussed a lot about how habits that can result in the protection of our environment don’t seem to be “trendy,” but who knows. Maybe we’ll be able to make leading a minimalist lifestyle cool.

The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” explained the lifestyle and sustainability of minimalism. While I agree that our overconsumption deeply affects the environment and is a source of many of our issues in society, I personally did not think the film was the best representation of what changes we can make to try to achieve a minimalist lifestyle. Something that stood out to me the most was the lack of diversity within the film. Most of the people who were part of the film or showing interest in the minimalist lifestyle were white and part of the middle class. Something else that stood out to me was the film's explanation of why people consume. They explained it was because of advertisements etc. but in my opinion it is all due to America's capitalistic ideals.
<br><br>
The American Dream is an example of America's capitalistic ideals. Everyone wants to achieve the American Dream which equates to wealth. It seemed in this film that those who decided to turn to a minimalistic lifestyle were wealthy and chose to make that change for themselves. However, someone who is poor and has to live a minimalist lifestyle isn't praised or seen as highly as those who choose to have this lifestyle even if they would be able to afford more. In our society, poverty is looked down upon even though based on this film, it is better to have less. I imagine a person of color, who lives in poverty and has to live a minimalist lifestyle, would not be accepted in society as the people in this film were who were white and had more wealth. This all goes back to the culture around money, success, and wealth that has been engraved in American society.

I definitely agree and feel that there is a certain amount of privilege to be held when being praised for this kind of minimalist lifestyle. The lack of diversity was also something  that I noticed throughout the film, where, as you said, wealthy people chose to create that lifestyle. What I found interesting that you said is that advertising is not what promotes us to buy things, it’s capitalism. This is very true, with advertisements being all around us, there is still that control from the major corporations that are constantly whispering in our ear to buy more of their products. What I remember from my childhood during the 2008 recession is my mom going to the mall and struggling to find parking and saying “I don’t know why everyone is saying that we are in a recession right now, especially with all these people at the mall carrying bags of items.” From a very young age my parents taught me what the difference is between wants and needs, which I view is a very important lesson for a child to learn. I remember one time in the car my little brother, probably 7 at the time, pointed out a homeless person on the side of the road and said “look at how much stuff he has! He must be rich!” This was a very interesting idea that the amount of stuff you have determines how much money you have when, in reality, some of those who make the most money don’t spend it on consumer goods but invest it in other things. However, I do agree that the people of color who live in poverty or someone who is poor and doesn’t have a choice but to live a minimalist lifestyle wouldn’t be praised at all compared to those who are white and wealthy.
<br><br><hr><br>

I agree with your statement, “I did not think the film was the best representation of what changes we can make to try to achieve a minimalist lifestyle.” I feel like a minimalistic lifestyle isn’t realistic within the social and economic inequalities and injustices of our society. I also think our society doesn’t allow for us to live a simple life because we have become reliant on the “easy lifestyle” our consumeristic world has created for us. As a result, we cannot survive without the system, because we created it. Society and consumer culture established an inevitable and unescapable reliance to the system, which has completely altered the way we can realistically live. I also agree with your statement about the corruption within American culture and the societal perception of wealth defining success as it relates to the documentary. It’s frustrating how the film emphasizes a meaningful life by living simply, but by those who are wealthy. Yet those who live in poverty do not have the means or choice to escape the life they live because of the corrupt capitalistic system that creates great economic inequality.

In the documentary, “Minimalism” it was explained the dangers of consumer culture and how some people have made the active decision to embody a lifestyle known as minimalism. Minimalism is essentially a lifestyle in which only the bare necessities are valued. It isn’t necessarily anti-consumption, but more of a conscience way of living. I think the documentary did a good job showing how consumer culture and materialism does not necessarily lead to happiness. They even included a quote by the famous actor, Johnny Depp making a statement saying that money does not lead to happiness. The documentary also made an effort to point out that it isn’t that difficult. An example would be the 33 challenge in which participants wore the same 33 articles of clothing for a month. This is a cool accessible way to show that being a smarter consumer doesn’t necessarily mean only having 5 things. Speaking of accessibility, I have made a similar comment before, but I will criticize this documentary for not at least acknowledging how a lifestyle similar to this can be incorporated into low income communities. Yes, I am sure it would not be that difficult for someone up the corporate ladder to give up things because of their income security but I know so many people who are worried about putting food on the table for the next day. While I understand this may sound unrelated; the entire time I was watching the documentary I couldn’t help but feel it just radiated the idea of “privilege” I do believe there should be at least something thrown in to show how minimalism could be incorporated into ones daily life without necessarily down sizing into a “small home” or getting rid of a lot of your wardrobe. Just a thought.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” because it really reflects how America is wasteful and incapable to living simplistic lives. People always want "more stuff," even though it is completely unnecessary. Before watching the film, I had no idea how impactful living a minimalistic lifestyle can be. In a society where everyone wants to follow the latest trends, plastic waste, clothing waste, and the trash overwhelm landfills and contribute to global warming. 
<br><br>
I think that Minimalism is an effective lifestyle change that can significantly benefit the environment. Burning trash releasing huge amounts of air pollutants and methane, contributing to the warming of our environment. People should accept the fact that a simple lifestyle where we prioritize food, shelter, and water is an ideal option to living sustainable lives. 
<br><br>
Improving our climate crisis is a group effort. We must "maximize" minimalism by encouraging people to adapt the lifestyle. One person cannot change the planet, rather it is a group effort that requires consistency and commitment.

I also really enjoyed the take away from "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things". Not only did my own negative effects on the environment become more apparent, but it was showcased how I could benefit from this new type of lifestyle as well. I was shocked at how wasteful Americans are in their consumer culture. However, similarly to you, I doubt that Americans are capable of such the drastic change that we need to see now to help the climate crisis.

It's sad and disappointing to see a species with so much intelligence and potential be so easily manipulated into doing things that are not only bad for ourselves but for our environment, our culture, and our economy. People spend so much time and money trying to find happiness when happiness is already within and is just clouded by all the distractions around us. People feel overwhelmed and cant seem to be able to stop and reflect for a minute because they want to be caught up with what's going on around them. People get into the routine of living passively and forget to pay attention to the things they do and the reason for why they're doing them. The question minimalist ask themselves before bringing or purchasing something into their life is, "does this add value to my life?" We need to be asking ourselves that question more often but we also need to change our definition of what value means. Friendships are valuable, time with family is valuable, time for yourself is valuable, and peace of mind is definitely valuable. I like how this way of life wasn't intentionally trying to do the best for the planet but what a coincidence that what's best for us is also what's best for the planet ... but people don't realize that and politicians and fossil fuel companies couldn't care less about making profit off of our health. 
<br><br>
I don't consider myself a minimalist but I can definitely see myself moving towards that lifestyle ever since I came to UCSB, now that I have a job and pay for my own stuff I watch how I spend my money and the best way of doing so is to not carry your credit/debit card with you and instead carry the amount you think you'll need. When I started doing this I obviously consumed less; less clothes, less fast food, less beverages that come in PLASTIC containers. Not only do you save money when you consume less but you really do help the environment when you don't consume more than what you need. A lot of the times you think you really need or even want stuff but I've honestly never regretted not carrying my card around, sure I missed out on some chips, a beverage, cute attire, but I realized I don't need to get something everywhere I go and it sounds easy to do but we're so used to buying stuff that it becomes a routine to some people and sometimes an addiction.

Minimalism was a very interesting film for me. The world encourages more and more
materialism, as everyone looks to satiate their desires to keep up with the Joneses and the
Kardashians. As a consequence, the carbon footprint of every individual increases
proportionately. All over the world industries try to keep up with insatiable demand, to the
detriment of the environment. Minimalism is an interesting concept because it stops this rise in
pollution at the root. 
<br><br>

If people would only consume less then we may not harm the world as
much as we are now. The idea of minimalism is to live with as little as possible, as much as
what has a purpose to the individual. The idea is certainly very interesting, but I think it is hard to
convert individuals to as people want more and more. I wish it was a viable option however I
don't believe people are willing to make the change and only have one, even only two pairs of
shoes. I think what needs to happen is people gradually come to consume less and less, and
not aspire to meet an American Dream with endless amounts of stuff. I enjoyed this movie and I
believe in its message for people to consume less to reduce our carbon footprint.

Voluntary minimalism requires strong willpower and high education. This is not something that can be done simply. Everyone needs a goal for which they work, and most people aim for a better life, not just for themselves but also for loved ones around them. The mother of a wealthy family will definitely want her family to eat more healthy and delicious; their father also wants the family's car to be safer; parents also want their children to grow up in a better environment. None of this is possible with minimalism.
<br><br>

And needs are inherently difficult to define. We feel that higher education is needed. Some people think that being able to read is enough. We feel that a balanced diet is needed. Some people think that it is enough to not starve to death. Times and concepts are changing. Maybe one day we will think that 5g is needed, bigger TV is needed, and even longevity is needed.
<br><br>



Even if this generation achieves minimalism, it will be more difficult for the next generation. For example, a thrifty Chinese parent may continue their frugal lifestyle after being rich, but they will not be willing to make their child as frugal as they are. Because they don't want their children to suffer as they once did. Many parents in China make their children extravagant after they have the money.

But should we call for minimalism? yes!!! Should we call for environmental protection? Yes!!!!!! Should I become a minimalist? NO

<p>
Minimalism, in my opinion, works like the original idea of socialism and communism brought up by Karl Marx. He argued that in order for communism to work, the entire global working class needs to revolt at the same time and overthrow the dominating system. Which mean that for minimalism to work, it needs to get almost every person involved in the system, and from a realistic point of view, it cannot happen. Not enough influence of minimalism could reach every point on earth, and the capitalist society is ceasing the spread of such influence through media. I am taking a pessimistic view on this issue, but I believe is it worth the debate. In the video: “Plentitude Economy”, I begun shaking my head as soon as I heard the speaker saying that if people worked less, life would be much better. This idea is, to a certain point, radical, telling a person who is working their a** off to support their family to work less is almost impossible; they have to please their family needs as well as their employers at the same time, and if the person was suddenly told to work less and get paid less, the initial response for a considerable amount of people would be: “then how can I pay my rent, my insurance, and many other things that are deemed as necessities?”. In the second video: “The High Price of Materialism”, the only solution that I think would be influential is the change in policies. It would serve as a domino reaction in which each system slows down their progress one by one, but it would certainly take a long time for everyone to become accustomed to it. Then again, the capitalist society would come and cease all actions against economic profit. Many are aware that we technically live in a society in which we are the “indentured laborers” to capitalism, but no one dares to stand against the system as it would destroy our future.

Minimalism was definitely my favorite film we have watched in this course so far. The people behind the novel and idea seemed so down to earth, and genuine about what they were trying to do. And seeing from their video, they actually walked the walk and did not do any empty preaching. I love how the documentary also addressed many different perspectives and how minimalism has helped people. In the end, they all realized that the mass consumerism we are taught as Americans does not lead to true happiness. Instead, it can only contribute to a feeling of emptiness, living paycheck  to paycheck, and in a way living to work so you can have more money to buy more things. Minimalism is a way against that, and helps people shift to work to live, focusing more on self. It reminded me a lot of Thoreau's ideals in the "Walden" and what he fought for. Clothes were something both things addressed, where fashion was the culprit for people discarding their clothes instead of using them fully and not having them for their functionality. One point in the documentary that reallly hit home for me was when the woman said we are not materialistic enough, because if we were, we would actually use things for their material value and get the most out of it as possible.
<br><br>
For myself, I tend to live pretty simple as well. As I look in my room in my apartment, I have few possesions and clothes, owning only enough to sustain. It is the best way to live on the economics level and for space, and when you really think of it, we do not need that much stuff. I only want to own things that are very important to me and I want to keep it that way. I feel this sense of minimalism, like the others in the documentary, helps the environment greatly. There is less waste produced as people do not go through things as fast and discard them, and with less demand, there could be less processing in factories and transporting so CO2 emissions go down. I may not individually affect the supply level of firms, but if everyone collectively owned only what they needed and to use things for what they are, consumerism would decrease immensely and the benefits would be ten-fold.

The biggest takeaway
from this film is the idea of being intentional with the materialistic things
in our lives. As an individual born in the 21st century, I've been taught my
whole life that success is found in how big your house is, the car you drive and
so on. While I had been aware of the concept of minimalism (as it began to
trend quite recently), this video showed me a more elaborate perspective; the
accounts of the real people who transformed their lavish lifestyles to
minimalist lifestyles is inspiring. As a rather materialistic person myself, I
found it astonishing that one could and would willingly live their life with
only fifty some things that could all fit in a backpack. While I find this to
be a bit more on the extreme side, "the minimalists" did lay out some
practical floorplans for a 600 sqft home that seemed practical and minimalist
at the same time. This is not to say, that I deem the minimalist lifestyle
"impractical." However, to a person who's worked their whole life to
"get to the top," (which almost always comes with the lavish
demonstration their wealth,) transforming their state-of-the-art mansions, 6
car garages and walk-in closets to a refined form of living would seem absurd
or practically unattainable. The truth is that we've been raised with high
standards of living which comes along with vast consumerism and while it would
take a great deal of effort and awareness to reconstruct society's
materialistic habits, little by little one could start making more intentional
choices as a consumer. This film demonstrates that the concept of minimalism is
worthwhile and can add value to your life by focusing on things that actually
matter. Quite ironically, there's really not much to lose.

I really enjoyed watching this film, in fact by the end I had chills. This film goes to show how much of an impact individuals can truly make. I enjoyed the two main characters building up their brand and their voice throughout the film, and showing how many people stood on their side once the concept was brought to life and shared. I feel as though this is a metaphor for how the climate crisis activists and we as a whole will be successful in creating a better planet to live on.
<br><br>
I personally never thought of being a minimalist or having any desire to become one, but while watching this I was looking at my desk thinking of how many unnecessary items it has on it, as well as the full closet I use for my clothes, meanwhile my roommates share one. I thought about how what was said about little being more is true, in that when you have less things, for example only the clothes you truly wear and love, or few accessories you desire, they become of more value to you. I thought about how I only actually wear 60% of the clothes I have in my closet, and it honestly made me feel repulsive of buying more any time soon. I am very into fashion, however I feel as though there's a more environmentally friendly way of being fashionable that has become trendy such as thrifting, and I am excited to pursue more of that route as I am more aware of it beneficial effects.

The documentary, “Minimalism” covers the idea of minimalism in every sense that it impacts our life. Not only does the documentary comment on minimising possessions, but it also comments on minimizing screen time and thoughts through meditation practices. I appreciate that there is an emphasis on the many other factors minimizing will impact your life. I agree that the chaos behind keeping up with phone notifications and busy schedules truly affects the quality of people's lives in today’s society. In addition, I don't think people realize how dangerous prioritizing monetary achievements more than personal connections will be in the overall happiness in your life. I really agree with the message in this film that money doesn't buy happiness and that everyone needs to make a point to truly find their meaning in this life. I never realized what kind of hectic narrative is sold to us at such a young age that having a 9-5 job is our only path in life, but Ryan and Joshua are two prime examples of people who believed that life style would bring happiness but found it wasn't. They instead practiced minimalism and found their true happiness in life, spreading the message of minimalism to others in order to impact their lives. 
<br><br>
The quote that impacted me the most was actually their last, which Joshua said, “Love people and use things because the opposite never works.” This resonated with me because it's so true. You use things for a purpose but when you start to love them, it becomes an indulgence and addiction. In addition, loving people is so important to a fulfilling life, but using them is never the right way to go. In an environmental sense, this documentary really shines a light on how indulgent Americans have been and how we need to change our lifestyle so we stop unnecessarily polluting our Earth. As a country we really should listen to Ryan and Joshua’s message, project 333, the tiny house movement, and many other minimal lifestyle changes in order to make a difference with our ecological footprint.
</p><hr>


<p>
The Minimalism Documentary really brought everything full circle in one of its final lines, "love people and use things, because the opposite never works." Many times in the pursuit of happiness we tend to use others to our advantage in order to achieve things that we believe would be unachievable without manipulating others. However, In the film, I found it very interesting how the idea of living as a minimalist doesn't mean giving everything up and is more about focusing on what makes you feel more fulfilled. For example, when the family explained how changing their lives was different for each of them and how some of them had more than others and they were okay with understanding each other's different needs. For Joshua and Jeff, it became very important for them to find true happiness that the corporate world did not provide them. Like Thoreau, they found that consumerism was the root of their unhappiness and focusing on their true necessities allowed them to truly be fulfilled. In my opinion, learning to understand what you need so that you don't get caught in today's harsh consumer heavy society is actually pretty reasonable. If you look at our generation we are very focused on self-care, thrifting, and learning to appreciate and fight for what we believe in among other things and in relation to the class, this would help in lowering our contributions to damaging the environment.

In "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", two men are experiencing life with minimalism. It is true that money can buy stuff, but it can not buy happiness. Many people devoted their time in business and earned a lot of money. However, they lost their health, family, and relaxation. Because everything in sight grabs our attention, we are overwhelmed by clutter. The neater, the less visual stress we have. A simple home let us feel calm. Also, it is easier to clean a smaller and simpler home for people. Besides, minimalism provides people with freedom. If we give up time spent in buying things, we will have more free time to do other meaningful things. It is wise to spend our limited time in a more meaningful way. More importantly, minimalism is helpful for protecting our planet. Since we will buy less things, sellers will use less materials to produce less stuff. In this way, more factories will shut down. Thus, less pollution will be produced on the Earth.
<br><br>
Children, even less than one-year-old, are using digital devices. This fact really shocked me. From my perspective, it is not correct to show children advertisements. This is because they are too young to control themselves. Kids want everything they like and most parents will satisfy them. However, desire is unlimited. As a result, minimalism is important. On the road to minimalism, we set an example for future generations that personal possessions are not the key to happiness, security can only be found in the heart, and the path to happiness is not the same as the path to material things. They cannot learn these valuable life lessons from school or the media.
<br><br>
Although it is hard to do what exactly as people in the documentary do, we can try our best to reduce our stuff in daily lives. Keep in mind: less is more!
</p><hr>


<p>
-       The minimalists, Josh and Ryan, explained minimalism in a numerous amount of ways that were all very understanding and interesting. My favorite notion of theirs was when Ryan explained the two different lives… a life with less and a life with more. You can live a life with less stuff, less stress, less money and you can live with a life of more… more time, more happiness, and more freedom. I think everyone needs to understand what they were trying to say here because I feel like most people depend on THINGS heavily rather than depending on themselves and other humans for happiness. 
<br><br>
-       Later in the movie a lady began to explain how psychologically we are emotionally connected to other people as young as the age of infants and recently people have been becoming more attached to objects rather than people. I think we need to all come to an understanding that in the end, we have each other, not phones, not designer clothes, not fancy cars, but solely the materials we need.

<p>
In the film, "Minimalism", I learned more about the idea of not only letting go of materialistic things, but also about how much of an impact how much stuff we buy has on the earth. I have seen these sort of ideas before in the show "Tiny Houses" and the book "Letting Go: The Dao of Decluttering". The tiny houses to me always seemed like it would be impossible to live in, but in Minimalism, I really liked the idea of the small and convertible apartments that they showed. The idea of decluttering has become more appealing to me because a woman in the documentary said that since decluttering her house and getting rid of so many things, that she has an easier time keeping her house clean and organized which is something I struggle with. When they showed the man getting rid of all his belongings (only owning something like 61 items total?! ), it amazed me how he just ripped up his school photo and shredded it. Something like that would be too valuable to me to throw away so easily but I could definitely see myself getting rid of other junk that I don't use that is more materialistic than memorable. Since moving out, I definitely felt like I have decluttered and I can fit basically everything I own in one car (other than large furniture like a bed and desk) and it feels good to know I can pack everything up and go somewhere but I feel like I could declutter even more and get rid of many clothes that I don't ever wear and other small, unnecessary items. I definitley have a problem with buying stuff to make myself feel "complete" and "satisfied" and while watching Minimalism, they really made me realize this and how bad of a habit it is. I think the idea of leading a minimalist lifestyle is so unappealing to so many people because that's not necessarily the "American Dream" or lifestyle we are used to. But, if I were to go in my closet right now and someone were to take even half of the clothes that I haven't worn in the last six months, I probably wouldn't even notice which proves to me that I have too much junk and need to seriously think about leading a more minimalist lifestyle.

This film was very interested in the fact that it didn’t really have to do anything with climate change but just at the fact that living a simpler lifestyle is better in so many ways. If a simpler life is better and is also what turns out to reverse climate change to period of cooling if we all just changed our lifestyle to be more considerate. 
<br><br>
However, this film really opened my eyes to see what’s really important when it come to what are necessities and luxuries. I’m really contemplating on becoming a minimalist as well because it just seems like a healthier style of living
</p><hr>


<p>
I greatly agree with minimalism as both a means to greater life satisfaction and happiness and a way to begin to heal our dying planet. It is quite obvious, but not often practiced, that things don't equal happiness, and the only "thing" that will make us happy no matter how much we have is meaningful relationships. A focus on acquiring more and more things will not only make people happier, but will also automatically make us more eco-friendly. I also appreciate Ken showing us this movie since I think it is a very important message. However, I think that the specific movie Ken showed us wasn't well suited for the audience of this class. I still greatly agree with the message, I just have some problems with the messengers. This movie makes it seem as if 2 white men invented minimalism and therefore solved America's happiness problem and environmental problem. While the movie does look at a lot of different people, the majority of these people are men and nearly all of them are white. I don't think a single woman of color was featured in this film. You might be thinking, "gender and race are important, but what does this have to do with a class on the climate crisis? We need to focus on saving the planet before we can worry about anything else." You're not wrong, but being more aware of race and gender will actually dramatically help the cause of mitigating the climate crisis. No matter what message anyone tries to send, the presenter must always be mindful of their audience for the message to be sent effectively. I don't think this movie (or the fact that this movie was chosen to be shown to this class specifically) thought of its audience. This movie presented the minimalism journey of white (and mostly male) people who gave up unfulfilling but greatly wealthy lives to be minimalists. It would be great to show this movie to an audience of white men who are currently rich and unhappy. This class isn't that. The majority of people on this campus are women, and while our campus is still very white, it is still more racially diverse than this movie. Additionally, many people on this campus didn't come from wealthy families and didn't have much growing up with--however, they are still susceptible to falling trap to the American Dream of consumerism. Instead of presenting a solution that was invented by white men (and as Ken admits, a first world problem to a first world solution), it would be better to present a solution that has existed in many cultures for generations. Many cultures (like mine since my family comes from El Salvador) value relationships, people, and experiences (with people, of course) over things. They don't throw out all their things and try to own 33 garments of clothing. But they understand that happiness comes from the relationships you have and the things you experience with people around you. They also don't buy things impulsively for the sake of having them. They only buy things when they need them. Yet, they have more than the guy who can fit his entire belongings into two duffel bags and their homes are far more colorful and inviting than a sad apartment with white walls. But the environmental and emotional effect is the same: people only have what they need--they just keep everything for longer. It seems silly and very wasteful to throw out everything you own in order to start a life of minimalism. All you have to do is stop buying things. Other cultures have already figured that out and have been practicing it for generations. I think that seeing a video of different cultures that are more representative of an increasingly diverse America would be far more convincing and effective than showing 2 white guys who are pretending to have discovered the secret to happiness.

The film “Visualizing a Plentitude Economy” made a statement which is “when people work less, they tend to consume less. The planet gets some time off too.” I highly disagree with it. I understand it means we reduce the pressure we put on the environment when we reduce the amount of our consumption, but I don’t think that’s the way which can help for the environment. Think it in this way: “work less” means more free time. What do we usually do when we get off work and enjoy our free time? It’s probably all in two options, staying home or going outside. First, if we stay at home, the usage of electricity and water will go up, and we certainly will have more trash produced. Second, if we decide to go out, we are generating more activities on the planet; no matter where we go, more wastes do come with us. As you cam see, these two methods aren't helping reduce human activities at all but generate more.
</p><hr>


<p>
Decluttering someone's life is 150% the way to go to reduce anxiety, depression and help with seeing what is important more clearly, without all the crap in the way. Like what Ken said, to be free. Free of obligations, ownership, free of objects and responsibilities. After watching the film, I thought of various tiny houses (similar to Walden I guess) that I really want to try those out at some point. I don't want to own a house or anything like that. In my opinion, everything should be shared because we don't all need a vacuum if we use it once a month. 
<br><br>
Lastly, I just feel like this film is coming from such a privileged place and yes a lot of people living in America are wealthy enough to be in this same situation as them but a lot aren't. I feel like people feel that "gaping void inside them", with which they "filled with a lot of stuff" just really have not found that thing that makes their heart burn and their blood pumped. Maybe they are just lost and without a clear goal and decluttering life could be helpful. But I just feel like there's so much work to be done that we could do so much better in fighting for other people's right to live and be. Moreover, as Jesse Jacob talks about "humans are wired to be dissatisfied", I come to realize that this dissatisfaction may only apply to certain people.
</p><hr>


<p>
Once I finished Minimalism, I couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that downsizing has been around for so long yet still society, me included, have in fact come to do the opposite and center our lives around the need to consume in order to fit in. It isn’t our fault as a generation that we were born into such a mindset; corporations have been convincing the common man to indulge themselves in the newest trends and gadgets since they were founded. What is our fault is the fact that our generation has countless amounts of evidence to support the climate crisis we are undergoing as well as plausible methods to help counteract that atrocities that are occurring, yet we still aren’t doing enough to implement change in order to save the future for ourselves and our families. The film assisted me in gaining a deeper understanding concerning the fact that our surroundings really influence us in terms of our consumerist ways, and that is only made worse through the implementation of smart phones and social media into our society over the past two decades. The film displayed that shutting off your life online and isolating yourself for a short period of time can in fact be healthy, as it gives oneself a much needed down time to regenerate and reconnect with themselves. Hopefully, this film had the same effect on a multitude of casual viewers like it did on me, because if so, our generation is beginning to realize how simple downsizing can be and how essential it is in order to save our planet before it's too late.

After watching the two videos on “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism”, it does seem like an ideal solution. Experiments conducted where the number of hours worked per week is reduced have shown that productivity and employee happiness has generally been raised when work hours are reduced. Despite this however, companies in America have overall refused to try it. I do not necessarily know why that is the case, could other experiments have disproved this trend? Or could it be that it is simply easier from a logistical standpoint to keep the work environment the same as it is? 
<br><br>
I personally theorize that the companies are resistant to making those changes because of how much effort it would take to shift over to an environment that theoretically works instead of just sticking with what is routine and comfortable. You see this in a more micro-level with people and making shifts to a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle. While this sounds easy to do, it is hard for people to give up what they currently have because it requires effort on their part. People are resistant to making sacrifices because they are comfortable with their routines. While it would lead to an overall better society if we could all make these changes, I unfortunately cannot help but be a little pessimistic of the odds due to how inert society can be even when many voices choose to speak up.
</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the film Minimalism, I can't help but to say how true all the points made in the movie were. Living a minimalist life has the opportunity to make someone find the greater things in life. A huge point that I found important was when Colin Beavan stated how "the thing that is not making us happy is also causing the degradation of our habitat." It's true, we as a people are so caught up in getting the newest and greatest things that we seem to forget how wasteful our lifestyle is. The film also related to the Walden reading we had to do, as they both make the case for living a simpler life without a lot of lavish things. I think that materialism is directly related to the climate crisis. It's a vicious cycle: a lot of people upgrade their phones, cars, and appliance even though they work perfectly fine. This reinforces the cycle of producing these goods to these same goods being thrown in landfills.

<p>
In the short films "The High Price of Materialism" and "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy", it was made evident that in order to effectively implement minimalism in our society, it needs to begin with things that don't lead to the same feelings of deprivation as not buying as many non-essential things. I found it quite interesting how a shorter work week can actually positively affect the environment with fewer carbon emissions. I feel like when people are overworked and stressed throughout much of their daily lives, they resort to buying things they don't need to try to make themselves feel better. However, this feeling is temporary and must be refulfilled, producing a never-ending cycle that defines consumerism. I think this is a vital step to improving our overall well-being because when we have more energy to engage with our lives outside of work, we are more likely to try new things and find different outlets for the stressors in our lives. As mentioned, people are more likely to start small businesses, hobbies and other things that would otherwise cause people to resort to the quick and easy solution that is consumerism. I believe this would provide them the willpower to make further changes in their lives to distance themselves from their dependence on buying things and find joy in the simpler things. However, our country's economy is largely dependant on people's addiction to purchasing non-essential things so this would be quite difficult to implement here. I think something like fewer work hours would be something that most would be on board with, so initiating the momentum for changing our lifestyles using this method could prove to be effective.
</p><hr>


<p>
Minimalism made me ponder about my life presently and I how Ive been raised. We live in a society where ads push us to want to have new things all the time. Like it showed in the documentary we are running to get the new items because it makes us feel like we have status. Once a newer version comes out we feel out of date and like are status has changed. This goes from electronics to fashion. But little do we realize that doing this is living in a very wasteful and materialistic world. We need to learn to be happy with what we have because if we are always chasing the newest thing we will never be happy.  
<br><br>
 One thing I noticed about the minimalist guys is that they went through life became wealthy and then realized how much pressure it was to work in what they did so they decided to give it all away and live a more humble life. Yet some people never had the opportunity to make it and become wealthy and then decide to live lives with less. Living lives with less is not a privilege to these people its a way of life. It's normal. What effect would this movie have on people that are already minimalists but not by choice?
</p><hr>


<p>
In the first short film it addresses how in order to create a more sustainable society we must completely change our economic system. They introduce the Plenitude Economy where the goal is to reduce work time in order to encourage the time outside of work to be spent on creative projects such as gardening, home improvement and DIY projects. The goal is to build a social economy. I liked this idea of changing how we spend our time because this goes back to the idea that Ken discusses, that the climate crisis is a cultural problem. We live in a fast paced materialistic society and in order to create real change we must change our values and appreciate time rather than money. 
<br><br>
Therefore leading into the next short film which gives two solutions into defeating materialism. One being, to understand why people prioritize materialistic things and two promoting intrinsic values. For instance without our new phones, shoes, bags and other material goods what wealth do we really have. Thus, we must culturally change what we find to be “cool” or “trendy”. Instead we teach the new generation to value character and morals rather than cars and sneakers. As an environmental studies major science and data may be overwhelming but consumer decisions and cultural shifts are just as significant if not more significant than the technology and science.
</p><hr>


<p>
I really like how the film incorporated to many clips of shopping. Specifically, I liked the scenes of the massacre on consumer goods that takes place every time Black Friday comes rolling around. Consumerism is a very sellable drug, and most of our population is addicted. Whether it's hunting the best deals to get as much as you can for as little as you can, or "big ballin'" and spending a lot of money on god knows what, most people find temporal satisfaction out of getting things. This is, however, designed to be short lived. 
<br><br>
Going back to the cigarette addiction comparison...
<br><br>

Nicotine has a buzz that lasts for only a minute, then, you are left waiting for your next chance to catch one. Your body craves the feeling, your mind wants the altering feeling, and you want the temporal satisfaction. This is perpetuated by companies who sell nicotine, feeding on its fleeting nature to sell more, more, and more of it. This is the same thing that mass producers do. From Iphones to GoPros and Computers, there is always a new model coming out. The models always promise new life changing features, and your “buzz” on your previous product wears off, and you find yourself fiending for another one. 
<br><br>

That’s buns. 
<br><br>

Essentially, if you let yourself become addicted to consumerism, you become a slave to the next products they put out. You put yourself into a cycle of buying, throwing out, and buying again. To break free from this cycle and enter a much more productive and reasonable way of living, you have to rid yourself of your addiction. Focus on what’s important in life. Out with the old but not in with the new quick pleasing products available. Just like in the movie, you might also find yourself with only 51 things left around you that you actually want to have around.

This model of "Plenitude Economy" is very ambitious, however, not unachievable. Almost all prospects of this model sounds very appealing to me, such as shorter work hours in exchange for longer leisure time dedicated to ourselves and our D.I.Y.s, such as gardening, small scale farming and more. Developing hobbies like small scale farming betters our environment by individuals or families becoming partly or fully self-sufficient in obtaining food and therefore limiting food waste and betters their own bank accounts by saving money on produce. Despite the many advantages of a "Plenitude Economy", like the creators of the youtube video admits, there are many other problems and questions that will need addressing. One question I have is if employees' work hours are reduced to allow more people to join the workforce, are their salaries also getting a reduction? I can already see disgruntled employers and employees waiting for this question to be answered. If salaries stay the same, employers will have to pay the original amount of salaries to the employees in addition to the salaries of newly employed workers. If salary is deducted from original employees to make up the cost of hiring new employees, how will the original employees maintain their living standards? Although the model proposed a seemingly ideal possibility, when it comes down to the logistics, many problems will need to be resolved. However, the "Plenitude Model" is one of the better proposals that I have seen when it comes to contemplating both economic and environmental concerns. The youtube video goes through this model very briefly, but I do think it is a viable option that I would love to learn more about.

<p>
The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," it made me realize that money really doesn't buy happiness. Sure, it'll probably give you happiness for a bit, but after that, you keep wanting more. You eventually spend more than you can make. While I definitely can't imagine myself living in such a small home, I can definitely see myself with less. Even sometimes, when there's just too much on my desk I get too stressed, even when it doesn't obstruct my view or anything. Seeing Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields enjoy their lives and promoting the minimalistic lifestyle on news outlets, made it seem rather easy and practical. We shouldn't think about what others think about what we have, but instead of what we do. If you're happy, then others should be happy for you too, otherwise keeping them around is rather toxic. When they occasionally panned over to the clips of Black Friday where people would fight over items, I learned that we are barbaric for unnecessary things and we really only want it to impress others with our "items."
</p><hr>

<p>
I like how you used desk clutter as an analogy of how having more things and consuming more and more throughout our life not only doesn't make us happy (in the long term), but only adds to the list of things we need to worry and stress about. Having less, or rather, only having what we NEED enables us to clearly see what deserves our attention and focus in our daily lives. It's not easy to ignore how others perceive you based on what you own, especially in college where you're constantly meeting new people and socializing, but I think being appreciative of what we already own can be a step in the right direction towards a minimalist lifestyle.
</p><hr>

<p>
When I first started watching the Minimalism film, I thought that living minimalistic would be really cool and easy. But, after seeing this film, I see all the reasons why I couldn't do it. I have too many items that I enjoy too much to part with. With that being said, I  think  the idea  of only owning a  few items of clothing is much more attainable for me. I usually only wear jeans/shorts with a  black or white shirt, so choosing my favorite of the bunch and donating the rest could be a  possibility in my future. 
<br><br>
The small houses seen in this film amazed me. I would very much be interested in living in a small space like that that changes throughout the day for what you need.
<br><br>
Something I disagreed with in the film was that more money doesn't make you happier. I feel like the wealthier you are, the less you need to stress about paying rent, meeting deadlines, putting food on the tables, etc. and the more you can focus on doing thing you like. The more you can spend of experiences that you make you happy. I agree that more stuff doesn't mean more happiness, but I feel like more money would.
</p><hr>

<p>
When watching "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I found it super interesting how this isn't an issue where climate change is the main proponent for pursuing this goal, but rather that we are pursuing this goal because it is mentally corrupting our society; it is an issue that regardless of whether you believe is global warming or not, we can all agree that our impulsive impulsive, materialistic mindset is manipulating us into mass consuming products in hopes of achieving some level of happiness. One particular scene in the documentary that i feel truly shows how much the mindset has corrupted our mindset was when the doors to a store opened for Black Friday and people started diving over display boxes, stealing items from children and putting other people in chokeholds (30:49-31:05). It is frightening and chilling to see and regardless of climate change beliefs, this is a serious problem we all need to collectively tackle. If everyone were to practice a much simpler, "minimalistic" lifestyle, we wouldn't only help save our planet from further pollution, but we also would significantly reduce the amount of mental health issues that we have in today's society. In total, we would be killing two birds with one stone.
</p><hr>

<p>
The two short films, "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" and  "The High Price of Materialism"  were very interesting and contained a lot of ideas i hadn't heard before. The first one brought up a new form of economy where hours of work are dispersed more evenly amongst a given population and how this style of economy can help ride us of consumer culture and even lead to better lives. Although I know little about economics, I think that this form of economy might be  little too idealistic, but with enough support and regulations, could become something great. I liked that they pointed out that people tend to care more about material goods when they are feelings insecure because I myself have always wondered that. In the second short film they talked about how much commercialization is embedded into our society and how there is evidence that shows that when people care too much about material items to define their success, they tend to be less happy with their lives. Along with this they pointed out how our drive for material goods also impacts the way we care for/treat the environment and how the two are negatively correlated. I think that overall these two films were extremely eye opening about the issues they discuss and give me hope that there are answers to our problems, we just have to be willing to try.

<p>
Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields explain their journey of speaking about there experiences of being minimalistic in their film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things". When I see this documentary I do believe that we can change society to be full minimalism. I feel that people will come on board if they are shown the truth. You do not need all of these new gadgets and clothes to survive and feel good in this world. There are so many other aspects of life that can you give you happiness. For example, an accountant was interviewed and he hated his job even though he was paid well and got a promotion. He then quit to find his true happiness and passion in this world. This person really inspired me because he stated that in American society the path is laid out for us. But for ourselves, we have to make our own paths to reach our true happiness. Once people realize these ideas, I believe we change society. It is going to be a challenge to change everyone's mind about have the best objects. But as this documentary shows, people actually come out and listen to Ryan and Joshua's minimalistic events. If we keep spreading this idea to everyone, then eventually everyone will start to believe in this new culture and change there ways. That means to spread ideas throughout TV, Social media, and even out in public. Also, by making minimalistic a trend it will be easier for people to get hooked on and try to be a  minimalistic themselves.
</p><hr>

<p>
As an international student who has lived outside of my home for many years, I really do believe that living minimally greatly helps me maneuver my stuff around when I have to go somewhere else or go back to my home country. There is less stuff to worry about, and I don’t have to carry a stack of luggages to the airport. 
<br><br>    We are materialistic in some way but not materialistic in another sense... I feel like this is a good quote. We are seeking for the quantity instead of quality. We are buying more and wasting more. We are destroying the environment and at the same time making our life miserable by embracing this consumer culture. This just makes minimalism more necessary in the modern day. 
    <br><br>I am not saying that I am a full-fledged minimalist in any way, all I am implying is that just by limiting the amount of stuff you have can make your life easier to handle, and start by getting rid of unnecessary stuff bit by bit can make a difference in our lives.
</p><hr>

<p>
“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” has been my favorite of the film assigned for this course thus far. Joshua Fields Millbrun and Ryan Nicodemus critique societal norms yet leave viewers with a plentitude of solutions and optimism if they are willing to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. Many of the “solutions” that “The Minimalists” suggest in opposition to a compulsory consumer society come through the reduction of clutter in one’s life mainly through material goods. It was enlightening to hear about the correlation between the reduction of material items one has and their overall happiness. We as humans become so attached to our material possessions and attaining items with monetary value that we lose touch with the real things that bring us happiness or as they called it in this film, “the important things”. 
<br><br>
“The Minimalists” mantra really stuck with me, “Love people and use things because the opposite never works.” I shared this documentary with several of my family members as I feel they could greatly benefit from viewing the film. I discovered that Joshua and Ryan have created a series of podcasts under their same “brand” name, “The Minimalists”, that are available on Spotify and even YouTube for free. I highly recommend checking them out!

I could not agree more with what you said and your opinion of this film. I was honestly surprised by the “real” approach to minimalism documented here - not the previous perception I had of it (which I will admit did involve Kim Kardashian’s so-called ‘minimalist’ decor in her mansion). I learned more and more about what minimalism was really about though as I continued to watch the documentary as Joshua and Ryan travelled the country. 
     <br><br>I do think it is interesting as Ken pointed out to see minimalism as a first-world solution to a first-world problem. From having a little, to having a lot, to having so much that you decide you would rather have a little again... I’ve honestly never heard of a more ironic situation to be in. I suppose though a return to owning fewer things in the spirit of minimalism is a better environmental choice than the consumerist mentality that we Americans would otherwise have and ravishly pursue. 
     <br><br>After hearing what Josh and Ryan had to say, if I am completely honest I began to feel a bit of anxiety looking at the clutter around me in my room. I think now after watching this film that a serious re-evalution of what brings me happiness is in store because I can guarantee you it is not from the clutter I can see right now. I think that a serious garage sale is due after watching this film. 
   <br><br>
     Thanks also for the Spotify suggestion! I definitely want to check that out in my free time.

The Film Minimalist was a good film. The whole time I was watching the film I was entertained with this whole idea of minimalist. Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Millburn which are the minimalist or at least that is what they call themselves. Minimalist meaning that you only have the bare minimum in order to live. Throughout the film it shows different way people define minimalist. Like for Millburn he has very minimal things in his apartment. He has a few of what he needs on a daily basis. Another example would be the person who lives off two carry on bags. This minimalist approach at least what it seems in the film isn’t defined by a set definition. Like for the family of four, they had a big house for four people. In U.S peoples success in this society is measured by how many things ones has. People measure success by buying the biggest house they can get. Success is currently measured by what one has. Which to me is honestly awful, like why do you need the latest car or clothing. You do not need 2 cars but people do have that and much more because being able to show off what you can buy basically equals to success. The Consumerism in America crazy and so bad for the planet. 
<br><br>
Minimalism is a start in order to help people and even the planet, but only to a certain extent I would say that it would be hard for the society we live in because this society is very materialistic and has a very big consumer culture. Throughout the film this whole idea of how money doesn’t buy you happiness is brought up. To a certain extent I get what they are trying to say. Many People live pay check to pay check because of their needs, it is for necessity not luxury.
</p><hr>

<p>
As someone who, as I’m sure all of us do, enjoys new things, I really enjoyed “Minimalism: A Documentary About The Important Things” because it was very relatable. Everyday things such as clothes or even food are affected by this culture that engrains to the point where we think the more expensive the better, when in fact, regardless of how much you pay for something, it will eventually decay or you will need to buy a new one. Today’s culture makes us associate what we want with what we “need”, when in fact all the commercials we see of all the new products and technology are extra to what really matters. As dark as it may seem, when you pass away no one is going to remember the things you had but instead who you were as a person and what you did to help other people. As corny—or extreme even—as that may seem, it’s true. That’s not to say we shouldn’t have anything materialistic, but it’s rather meant to invite people to step back and realize that whatever you own or have to your name is not what makes up your identity or should even dictate your happiness.
</p><hr>

<p>
It’s saddening to think about how society has been shaped largely around consumerism and materialism because to an extent, I believe it’s not completely the consumer’s fault. Corporations and businesses like to say that they are simply fulfilling the demand of the consumer, but where is that demand stemming from? As the video “The High Price of Materialism” suggests, people often buy things when they feel insecure and advertisements love to make us feel insecure. Clothing ads feature extremely commercially attractive and “idealistic” people resulting in insecure and uncomfortable customers and from that a low self-esteem seed is planted which alters the consumer’s outlook on virtually everything. When a consumer is insecure they are constantly seeking which results in more buying, thus contributing to the toxic cycle. This cycle has become normalized and has been the reason for many people’s anxiety, stress, and frankly, depression. I began to feel pessimistic about it all, but Ken’s sentiment about attempting to reinvent our current rampant material culture really hit me because it’s true, although it seems like the odds are against us, it’s worth a shot. Society’s overall happiness and quality of life depend on it. 
<br><br>
“Visualizing a Plentitude Economy” outlined a quintessential model of how our American economy should be. We’ve been conditioned into being workaholics which results in spending less time connecting with one another. I think at the root of this ideal is simple human connection and empathy. Restoring this would bring many of us out of the rut and cycle of mindless lifestyles.

<p>
I think this film was one of the more influential films on sparking a personal realization on the things I own and how much I actually need. When I take a step back, I start to see that many of the things I own- my computer, phone, headphones, xbox, car, etc… are all things I could live without. However, the pressures of advertisement and living up to social expectations make it extremely hard for myself and others around me to get rid of our possessions that somewhat define who we are as individuals. It was very interesting to see how reducing the amount of possessions we have in life can not only foster a positive environmental impact, but it can also make us happier and less depressed as we grow older. 
<br><br>
The only part of the film I had some trouble with is that for most, the extreme change they are advocating for would be too dramatic for some to handle, therefore they might not even consider any sort of change. The film makes it seem kind of like if you do not go all the way then you won’t experience the feelings of happiness that we did.
<br><br>
Overall I think that the notion of minimalism is an important one and that by reducing some amount of clutter in all of our lives, we have more time to pursue things we love with less stress and worry.

In the past six months since graduating high school, traveling alone over the summer, and starting school at UCSB in the fall I have thought a lot about the way we are expected to live and consume in America. Although my parent's house isn't big and compared to many they aren't rampant consumers, the experience of being on the move in Europe for a month with only my medium-sized backpack, sharing rooms with multiple strangers, completely opened my eyes. Living in the dorms and sharing a tiny space and bathroom with other people reiterated this message. I found I preferred the dorms and the hostel to the two story house in which everyone has their own room and space. I preferred to have my backpack with only a few outfits that I wore most often to a huge wardrobe full of things I hardly ever put on. I think being in a smaller space and having less stuff around me made me more aware of my surroundings, made me closer to the people I shared space, and made me feel more connected to my own thoughts and emotions. When we have too much space to ourselves and too many belongings, I think we subconsciously feel more self-centered--and with that, more lonely. Humans are meant to live together, to work together, to share items and space and experiences. When we become obsessed with accumulation, as many of the people featured in this film did, these essential traits are put out of practice. 
<br><br>
As Ken said in this video, minimalism a first world solution to a first world problem. Most people around the world are not in a position to be complaining about having "too much," and I think this is crucial to acknowledge. The U.S. is like this huge social experiment, and right now we've reach this weird place where a random selection of people have way more than they need. The issue is, they feel entitled to it, largely because "American Dream" rhetoric tells them they should be. The minimalism movement kind of works against this harmful trend.

After watching the film, “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I had to consider whether this was a lifestyle I could realistically make. Especially for 1st or 2nd generation individuals, either they themselves or their parents push them to pursue a materialistic life. After all, part of the reason of moving to the US is to live a "better" life, a rich life with a big house and nice cars. Therefore, it's hard to chase a minimalist life style as it almost contradicts lots of immigrants' line of thinking. Further, even if an individual is okay with a minimal lifestyle, they may feel uncomfortable going through with it if their parents are against this kind of lifestyle. I know growing up my parents have always joked that I need to make money so that I can buy them nice cars in the future; I'm not sure how they'll accept a minimal lifestyle. Because of all the benefits of a minimal lifestyle however, I have to consider this option in my life.

I never quite understood the great extent to which consumer culture has been ravaging in our society until I got to college. I quickly realized that I had way too much stuff, and most of it were things that I had little to no use for. My roommate, on the other hand, was leading a very minimalist lifestyle and had very few possessions. Not limited by money, he chooses to own just enough clothes to get him through the week and likes to spend his money and time on activities and hobbies that are more economical and environmentally-friendly. It's been rather interesting to watch him lead his minimalistic life as it is a lifestyle that seemed entirely foreign to me. Going out to buy things and shop for items that are short-lived has become a popular pastime that is so wasteful and unnecessary. Having seen the minimalistic ideal in-person has been transformative for me, as it has "curbed my appetite" for more things and helped me realize I don't need more things to live a satisfactory and comfortable life. 
<br><br>
I think "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was a very engaging documentary that did a fine job of selling the minimalistic approach to life. Their take on simplistic living and breaking away from consumerism to lead a more liberating and meaningful life was quite good. With the rise of social media and the growth of massive companies, we've become so reliant on this idea that we need lots of things to not only be happy, but to just get by. What I found interesting was that we need to do more than just buy less, and buy things that will last and be of good use for a long period of time.

In the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” the two characters in this film illustrate their lifestyle — Minimalism. Minimalism is a lifestyle that consuming less, live in a small space so that they can protect the environment. From my perspective, Minimalism is not just limit people’s desire to purchase staff, but to find what you really want from this complex world. Not being misled by advertisers, but what you really need. In the project 333, people can just dress 33 items or less for 3 months, and no one will find that. So, we don’t need to concern about people will judge the clothes we often wear. We seem to reverse the order of life, lose the sovereignty of life, and become slaves to desire. Thoreau, the forerunner, spared no effort to awaken us in our nightmares with his own experience and wise philosophies, abandoning the extravagance of luxury, cutting off the shackles of desire, returning the vitality of life, and enjoying the local scenery. It's hard to change this situation. I think we may be able to find a way to balance desires from minimalism. We are all ordinary people and we are unlikely to give up our items. We seem to reverse the order of life, lose the sovereignty of life, and become slaves to desire. Thoreau, the forerunner, spared no effort to awaken us in our nightmares with his own experience and wise philosophies, abandoning the extravagance of luxury, cutting off the shackles of desire, returning the vitality of life, and enjoying the local scenery. I think this film just want to help us think about the practical meaning of everything, instead of seeing the image created in the advertiser to buy the product. We should learn to do things that make us happier and more meaningful, rather than simply killing the desire to buy. Love people, use things.

Thank you for your explanation of the documentary, "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things". It was informative and gave an insight into the idea of the documentary, which again is about living a simple lifestyle. The idea of minimalism sounds very appealing, but can be associated with repressive tendencies and emotional issues. We as people seem to want many things and the practices that a minimalistic lifestyle take that away. In the project 333, people can only dress between 33 items at once, and that is to take away the way people judge each other based on clothes. I also agree with you surrounding our order of life, and how our greatest desires determine how we behave and the choices we make. The work and reward dynamic that is an integral part of how we operate is almost non-existent in a minimalist lifestyle. The documentary definitely exposed the idea of this lifestyle, and did a very good job at explaining their practices and purpose.

Film: Minimalism.

A large proportion of people dream of enormous houses, but they do not realize that they can not actually use all of the houses. I noticed in the film that “people use only 40% of all the rooms and spaces.” The resource they use is not utilize properly could lead to large mount of waste. Such waste will contribute to the greenhouse gases increase. Also, “nothing is more responsible than living in the smallest place you can.” Think about it, compare with living in a big house, what shortages does living in a small place have? I can barely come up with one shortage. You can have living room, bedroom, kitchen, and all the thing you need even in a small home, the only thing is just all of them are smaller, but it does not make a huge difference. By the way, you can also save a large amount of money by doing this. So why not?

One quote that stood out to me in this documentary is “human identity is no longer defined by what one does but by what one owns.”  This quote resonates with me because it was so easy to accept it as true and made me so sad and disappointed in our society.  I really enjoy looking at the crisis of consumerism alongside the climate crisis because I feel as though it is really easy for people to understand. For me personally, I know a lot of maximalists as well as a few minimalists and in watching this documentary I was able to connect to it so much because of these people in my life. Minimalism has always been appealing to me, but it wasn’t until I met my boyfriend that I really began applying the practices of minimalism to my own life.  He is a minimalist by nature but does not preach it to others and never actively tried to convince me of his lifestyle, I changed the maximalist nature that I grew up surrounded by simply because of the joy that I gained from being in his room and traveling with him and seeing how everything that he owned was something that he loved.  I remember the joy I saw from him when he cleaned out his closet at the end of the year and donated what he no longer used, at first I was confused by this but I realized the profound connection that cleaning out one’s belongings can have on the feeling of clutter in the mind.  Another time I saw the benefits of a minimalist lifestyle from my boyfriend was the pride that he exhibited when he packed up his dorm room and fit all of his belongings into his small car. In opposition to my boyfriend's minimalist lifestyle, I have seen the opposite in others that I am close to. I would describe many of my housemates as anything but minimalists. Our living room does not have a single blank wall and in a four-bedroom house we have 11 wall tapestries. Minimalism is trendy for a reason and I am fully supportive of the Marie Kondo fad that is currently sweeping the nation.

The documentary "Minimalism" was very entertaining and eye-opening to watch. It was crazy to see how two corporate business men changed their lifestyle to minimalism and became much happier. They were unhappy with their lives sitting in cubicles, even though they were making good money. They wanted to be happy and realized that they did not need as much in their lives to be content.  Being rich and famous isn't always the solution to happiness in life, as these two men realized. People nowadays are materialistic and are always wanting more to fill their personal voids. People are always wanting the newest clothes and technology, but do not need it to survive by any means. People need to take a second and ask themselves if the things in your life have meaning. It was interesting to watch how some people chose to live in little homes and utilize their space to the maximum. This is very environmentally friendly and also makes people happier because they do not have to rely on as much to survive. Those who chose to live simpler, minimalistic lives seem to have more meaningful connections in their life. They have quality over quantity and appreciate the things they own. It is important to pay attention to the important things in life that make us happy and not worry about materialistic things. Everyone in society should challenge themselves to become minimalists. Everyday try and use one less item or buy one less thing that you do not need to survive. This is important for our self health and would make a big difference to our environment as well.

Out of all the films, this one was probably my favorite because it was extremely relatable. One major problem that I have is living a minimalist lifestyle because I always like to go out and buy new clothes and shoes whenever I get paid. However this film made me realize that by continuing to search for happiness by purchasing items, I am contributing to the planet's poor health. One thing that an expert in the film said that caught my attention was "Americans are living their best life ever, but there's still a longing for more." Experts mention advertisements and social media as encouragers of this consumerist lifestyle. Advertisements make us feel like we need more to fulfill our lives, when in reality we don't need those things to make us happy. In addition, our culture is very competitive and everyone is trying to overachieve by buying the biggest home, most expensive car, have the biggest pool, and more. As a result, many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and our planet is taking the toll for it. 
<br><br>
Joshua Fields Millburn's story of how he achieved happiness through living a minimalist lifestyle was truly moving and inspiring. In the future, I will try to emulate his ways of living so that I can become happier and help the planet improve its current state. I liked how he said the problem isn't consumption, its compulsory consumption, which is extremely right.  Another part of the film that was inspiring was when a couple decided to live in a tiny home. This was inspiring because it's truly a sacrifice to live in such a compacted home, but if more people did this, then less habitats would be destroyed. The people in the film said that in order for things to change, the mindset that "big is better" or what constitutes a successful life needs to change. I'd agree with this statement, however, I don't think people should feel forced to worsen their life if they're willing to make other changes such as going vegan (which would help lessen the waste of water) or grow their own crops.
<br><br>
I would rate this film a five out of five because it was extremely informative and enjoyable to watch. Because of this film, I will soon start to live a minimalist lifestyle which will save me money and help the planet's environment heal from its wounds. I'm glad that these two are making a difference and getting coverage on NPR and NBC, hopefully more and more people become aware and make changes to their lifestyles.

I think a shift to minimalism is essential for our planet and very valuable for our souls. I don't really have to say anything to convince whoever reads this comment that consumerism is absolutely rampant throughout Western society today, and because of the dominance of our culture, the world. That minimalism on the scale of an entire economy would have impacts such as freeing up people's time totally surprised me. It's such an obvious fact but totally went over my head. I think that when the average American gets more free time, they will probably dedicate more time towards watching TV or maybe even getting another job. However, it is entirely possible that our attitudes towards this could change over time. I think a society in which people spend more time doing the activities they love would greatly benefit the society as a whole. It's possible the massive obesity problem in our country could decrease or disappear altogether. In theory, these things will be great but getting an entire society to give up one of its central values (a value supported by very valuable people, nonetheless) is very difficult. However, the US is in the midst of massive social change. Thanks to social media and the internet, more young people are directly involved in social activism than ever before. It is definitely possible that minimalism becomes a central tenet in more people's lives, and will contribute largely to our planet becoming more sustainable.

The film minimalism gives us the simplest solution to climate change, minimalism. I read a few weeks ago in the comments about “moral laziness”, throughout these past few weeks I have come back to this statement over and over because of how it perfectly describes our society. During week 1 we watched the Netflix documentary “Before the flood” in which Leonardo DiCaprio interviews Sunita Narain. This opened my eyes to the fact that as individuals we do not have the same carbon footprint, and very often this is related to our financial means, poorer people live more minimalistic lives.  However, this film introduced the idea that wealthy people living in highly developed countries should live more minimalistic lives. This would be a very simple solution to climate change, there would be less need for energy production, as well as almost every industry in the world. The fashion, meat industries… would almost cease to exist as we know them. However, almost no one would commit their lifestyle this drastically to the climate crisis, and it is unrealistic to expect such drastic measures to be taken by the vast majority if people. It would be very easy for people to make small adjustments to their daily lives  such as owning only 1 car per household, becoming vegetarian, or even buying fewer clothes per year. Yet again we run into the topic of “moral laziness” if you ask people on the street or at a restaurant if they would be willing to switch to a veggie burger rather than the beef burger they are about to order, many would say no because they like the taste of it and that’s what they want. If you then would tell them about the environmental benefits of switching to a veggie burger, they might either order a veggie burger or just get upset that you made them feel guilty about the burger they want to enjoy. I think this documentary is very interesting and we should all be committed to changing at least one small part of our lifestyle to collectively reduce our carbon footprint.

<p>
Personally I see the appeal of minimalism. The idea of maximizing the value of a smaller quantity of items is appealing because it allows you to live much more efficiently. That being said, American consumer culture is centered around the idea of as much as possible. This makes the idea of minimalism much harder to adopt since it goes against what we grew up believing or dreaming of. IF we could shift over to a more minimalist culture then we would consume much less, reducing our carbon footprint drastically. This is not a simple transition though since it defies what people have worked their entire lives for. Not everyone will be able to embrace the idea that less can be and often is, more.
</p><hr>

<p>
Much like this week’s Thoreau reading Minimalism calls into question our search for more material goods. Like the reading, the movie talks about the puppetry that much our lives are. We feel the need to consume because we think it will make us happier or make our lives better, when in reality that is the opposite of what happens. We end up in a cycle of consumption, where we get bored of the old and feel the need to replace it with new items. Advertising and media  propagate this belief to be far worse. Humans compare themselves to others, and want the same luxuries that they think make other people's lives enjoyable. We have far to much excess clutter in our lives. Minimalism demonstrates how stripping this clutter can improve our own lives. It shows how the important items start to add more value to your life when the necessary is removed. 
<br><br>
It is interesting and refreshing to see the personal improvements that come along with minimalism. While at first I expected the movie to be all about how minimalism can help save our planet, it was far more about the internal growth and improvement that come along with it. The film shows how changing our practices can not only improve our planet, but also improve ourselves, our well being, and our happiness.
</p><hr>

<p>
Minimalism highlighted our need as humans to consume. The statistics stated in the film such as: we only use 40% of our living space. and that we. have 3 times the space as a person in the 50's, really made me think about my consumption of materialistic things. I've noticed that a lot of people in my family tend to spend without thinking, and end up with a lot of clutter and things that they do not need. My lifestyle was somewhat similar. to theirs when I was. living under there roof. However, when I moved to UCSB for school, I made a decision that I wanted to cut back on as much "stuff" as I could. I now live in a much smaller space than I did before, but I also have far fewer things. I've noticed that. I have a lot larger ratio of things that are necessities to things that I want rather than need. Since then, I've actually felt a lot freer. Letting go of all of the things I had before (I donated them to various places) helped me not only move forward in the big jump that is leaving for college, but it also prepped me for an organized lifestyle. I enjoy having less because the things I do have, I use far more. 
<br><br>
Moving on from personal anecdotes, I think that this film truly shows how positive minimalism can be. By constantly purchasing, we are support the growing fast fashion industry, which leads to a question of morals. I had to watch the film The True Cost for one of my classes last year, and it showed the horrible effects of fast fashion people around the world. Many women in less developed countries work in factories in horrible conditions making cheap clothing for fast fashion stores such as Forever 21. I saw the impact this had on those families who worked factories, and decided to cut down shopping, and begin buying nicer, longer lasting clothes, but less often. Thrifting is also a fantastic option, and I am very happy that it has become trendy. Recycling clothes is also a great environmentally conscious action because many clothes are actually simply thrown away into landfills, creating piles and piles of clothes. Many clothes donated don't even make it out to people because there are so many clothes being given away. 
<br><br>
Minimalism is a great way to take on this issue. Buying less clothes reduces your impact on the environment as well as the people who make the clothes. Consuming less also means dumping less, as you are owning fewer things, and they are more valuable to you. I think that minimalism is a great approach to helping the environment, and am happy. to have gotten tips on it from this film.

Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things does a good job at showing real examples of people living some form of a minimal lifestyle. It touches upon some of the benefits of living with less things, with some of the main points being that it can be more affordable, environmentally friendly, and above all makes you happier. It also touches upon ideas of consumerism and interviews many "successful" people that have had well-paying careers but have since given up their 9-5 for a freer lifestyle.
<br><br>
While I agree that living a minimal lifestyle with less consumption is an integral part of ensuring a sustainable future, I think the film only depicts how minimalism works for a certain socioeconomic group of the middle-upper class. Almost all of the people interviewed are people that don't have to worry about making ends meet with bills and living expenses - instead they actually have "too much" stuff. One of the main guys talks about how he was living "paycheck to paycheck" but he explains that it was because he was buying too many things, not because he was struggling to feed himself and pay rent. I think it is important to understand that to a certain extent there is some privilege associated with even being able to live as a minimalist as depicted and the happiness that people claim to get from it is relative and not going to be true for everyone.
<br><br>
There are certainly good points to take from the film, however, and I completely agree with the messages communicated in the two short films from New Dream on the "Plentitude Economy" and "High Price of Materialism". I think that having the 80% work week is a really good way to tackle both issues of mental health and the fast paced workaholic culture that contributes to materialism. Just a quick google search came up with multiple articles on how research supports the benefits of a shorter work-week, so the evidence is readily availible. This idea should be popularized more so that employers and people in charge start adopting this type of workplace practice. I think that systematic changes like this are essential in making the cultural shift away from a consumerist society.
</p><hr>

<p>
The documentary, Minimalism, did an excellent job reinforcing my ideology that living with less is more fulfilling and better for the planet itself. I have always tried to keep my possessions to a minimum because I believe that having less material items creates less clutter and is also less wasteful. I found it really remarkable how Ryan and Joshua essentially went on tour to market this book with only a very little following base initially. Towards the end of the film they had way more support which means that people clung on to their concepts of living and applied them to their own life. 
<br><br>
One of my favorite parts of the film was when they converted the small living spaces into fully functioning apartments. While thoughtful and efficient architecture is fully necessary to accomplish this, I.T. made me feel more inclined to maximize the most I can with as little space and possessions as possible. Ryan and Joshua make I.T. their goal to create small functioning living spaces where people are also connected and brought together. I really liked how they had this intention. I believe that so many people buy products they only use once which is extremely wasteful. Not only is I.T. a waste to let that object sit around without use, but the waste made in creating the object also adds up. It's a sad reality that the world we live in, especially in the US, feeds off so much of consumer culture. I think that by making the tiny house, no car, second hand purchase life-style more trendy and hip, people will be more inclined to do so. I know I certainly am!
</p><hr>

<p>
Watching the two short films was fun and, if I'm being honest, hilarious. Cloaked in the language of harmless minimalism, personal responsibility, and liberal environmentalism was the core of modern environmental socialism. Not that I'm complaining: I'm all for it! It's just taking the socialist values that I hold deeply, that I have advocated for with phrases like "democratic control of the means of production" and "post-scarcity society" and "surplus labor" and rebranding it into the terminology of quaint and cute coastal environmentalism. Certainly, it'll probably reach a larger audience that way. But all the talk about how we need to stop endless growth, how we need to focus on what we have now, on how we need to work less and use our maximally-productive economy to work for us rather than having us work for it... well, it's pretty simply Marxism! 
<br><br>

I don't have too much to add here. I mean, I love what these films were saying, and agree one hundred percent. But I am genuinely laughing to myself as I'm typing this, because it seems so very off-brand. While there is certainly a branch of environmental activists and actors that embrace the socialist idea of how we need to transform our society, it is usually a very different branch than the one that talks about personal responsibility and more than that *culture*. Material and ideological politics seem to be weirdly intersecting in this niche little short films, and I am, as previously mentioned, all for it. What an odd couple videos.

We, as humans, are all driven by this biological urge to consume made collected objects. This kind of attachment to objects doesn’t necessarily make us happy because we are largely driven to these incentives by the commercials which are selling their products by selling the concept of being successful and perfect with their products. However, the hollow within us won;’t be easily fulfilled by chasing what we don;t really want.
<br><br>

The solution to this problem is minimalism. A lifestyle without objects not necessary and products that doesn’t please you. This is not just the solution to the problem in our mentality, but it’s also a feasible cure for the environmental issues. However, as Ken asked in the video, can we maximize the effect of it?
<br><br>

First, as ken mentioned earlier, it is a first-world solution to the problem first-world created. When you have experienced the best standard of living and decided that you’ve had enough of it, you’re allowed to adapt yourself into a new lifestyle. But if one is born in a household that’s empty because he’s family can’t afford anything, it’s hard to convince him to give up his dream of being wealthy and obtain whatever he wants.
<br><br>

Secondly, the mentality might not be for everyone. Throughout the video, people are complaining about their craving for more discouraged them from being happy. However, I know many people my parents’ age who earned their family a comfortable living condition find it hard when retired because they are suddenly deprived of their biggest hobby and since they’ve been living a life with little desires. They felt hollow. For those people, is minimalism truly the cure?
<br><br>

Generally, the idea of minimalism is a great solution and i can tell it will be effective in releasing the pressure we have currently put on earth. However, the idea can be promoted, should not be generalized with compulsions.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the Minimalism documentary, the minimalist group touched on the importance of ridding the world of their materialistic ways. This film heavily relates to the values portrayed by Thoreau. In our global economy, many people make money through consumerism which is why the anti-materialistic ideals are not expressed and advertised more commonly.
<br><br>
Global CO2 emissions would be significantly lowered if more people followed the ideas expressed in not only the documentary but in the reading as well. It is hard to imagine a world where people don't value materialistic goods as this is what keeps people motivated to work as stated in the documentary.

After watching the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I was left wondering if I should try the minimalist lifestyle or not because I am someone who loves shopping, and although it may make me feel good at the moment the feeling does not last forever. I would probably not be a hardcore minimalist because that just seems unrealistic for me, but  I still want to try and decrease the number of unnecessary things I own. I feel like we get caught up in the material things that it just makes us unhappy because we set unrealistic expectations for ourselves. I enjoyed the film because I used it to reflect on my own life and lifestyle. I have a lot of clothes that are still new and have never worn or clothes that I only wear once and then discard them so it made me realize how wasteful I am when it comes to clothes.
</p><hr>

<p>
While watching the documentary “Minimalism” I thought about all of the stuff that I own and how much of it I really use. In my closet lies seventeen different pairs of jeans and who knows how many tops or other types of clothing I have. The film discussed how our “attachments to people spill over to objects” and I definitely see this in my everyday life. Many people my age name their inanimate objects, this leads to attachments to them. My friend thought it was weird that I hadn’t given my Brita filter a name. I agree with the movie in that our attachment to objects and materialistic goods is us trying to fill a void of of lack of human attachment. When the movie discussed how people typically check their phones 150 times per day and more, I thought about how much time my friends and I spend on our phones. I know if I got rid of my phone I would have a lot more free time, but I don’t think it would reduce stress. I would be more stressed that I was missing out on things with my friends. Reducing consumerism, especially in america, would help mitigate an increase in the climate crisis. However, I’m not sure how we could achieve this as a society. The people who have the financial security to live this way usually choose not to, and the rest of the american people are living paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford long lasting goods. I agreed with the idea of the American dream being just one of many templates. I definitely do not want my life to align with the traditional american dream. I think the american dream is whatever you want it to be.

<p>
The film Minimalism was incredibly effective at introducing and motivating people to question consumerism, despite its uplifting tone. Instead of highlighting the downsides to consumerism and its environmental impact through alarming statistics and footage of landfills, the speakers discuss the ways that minimalism has benefitted their lives personally. For me, this was best shown through Joshua Fields Millburn’s personal account of how capitalistic culture ruined his relationships and wellbeing, and the realizations he had on the journey to minimalism. For me, I was able to form an emotional connection to him, which made me more open to the minimalist lifestyle. Overall, I believe this tone resonated throughout the whole film. Between the warm, community-oriented tone the minimalists and non-competitiveness between the minimalist lifestyles, minimalism was presented as an easily attainable goal for everyone. The message of “It’s not about getting rid of everything, but being mindful of what you have and what you buy” is something that everyone can take to heart. I think that this approach of making climate issues personal and non alarmist when possible is an especially important lesson for filmmakers to learn as the climate debate becomes more divisive. 
<br><br>
 In regards to Ken’s closing question, I believe that it will be incredibly difficult to transform our consumer culture. However, if we present minimalism in this manner, that people should be mindful about their purchases rather than rebel against all consumerism, I believe that people could choose the minimalist lifestyle for their own benefit, while also helping the planet.

<p>
I would like to comment on the Youtube video “The High Price of Materialism” because it mentioned a point that really resonated with me. It talks about how people tend to buy things and value materialism when they are looking for a way to cope with sadness or anger. To all the people who may not know or understand why people buy things to feel better, I can assure you that it is a real thing. I find myself buying literally anything when I feel sad, specifically material things that are not quickly consumed (clothes, jewelry, stationery, makeup). Honestly, I don’t know why it makes me feel better, but it just does. In fact, a few years ago, I found myself thinking “hmm, I haven’t bought anything in a while. Let me find something to buy”. It has definitely helped a lot when I picked up hobbies and exercised more often. The video doesn’t talk about finding hobbies as an alternate way to cope, but I find it very helpful.
<br><br>
I liked how the video talked about other ways to cope with negative emotions, and I will be sure to try them. I really do want to slowly start focusing solely on the non-materialistic things in my life, like family and friends, but it is definitely a long process. Not only will it help the environment, it will make me feel happier, too.

<p>
This film communicated its subject very well. They explained how we don’t need many of the things that we own, and they showed us how they live their daily lives. They made it sound like we were ridiculous for owning so much stuff that we don’t need. This is expressed when Joshua Fields makes a list of things he’d need when he was moving out after his marriage ended. This scene shows the audience that most of the things that we would consider to be “basic necessities” are really things that we don’t need. It is simply what society makes you believe that you need to have in your home. This is something that I’m pretty sure everyone is guilty of. We all want to have a nice big home along with all the luxury items; however, that wouldn’t actually make us any happier. We have all heard the phrase “money doesn’t buy happiness” and this film shows us what that really means. The film shares the lives of people who decided to give minimalism a shot and shows how happy they have been since they made the change. Joshua shows everything he has and said that all of his stuff can be fit into his backpack. 
<br><br>
This film is filled with great ideas but honestly, I don’t believe that people would be willing to make this big of a change in their lifestyle. Minimalism is an interesting topic and even though it doesn’t directly target the environmental crisis, it would still make a huge impact on it if we would be willing to make this change.

The movie Minimalism truly put the concept of happiness and desire into perspective.  As I watched the movie, I began to think how truly scary it is that our society is programming people of all ages to seek happiness in material goods.  What’s even scarier is that as time goes on, companies are targeting younger and younger age groups.  As this consumer culture continues to grow, it will not only have dramatic effects on the value we place on materialistic things but also our consideration for the environment.  The effect that growing consumerism is having on the environment is perhaps the most intense effect of this all, and it is up to the growing movement of minimalism to reduce these effects.  Although it is difficult to imagine a world where advertising is not infiltrated into literally every aspect of human life, it is quite possible that growing minimalism will help people to reexamine the way our culture thinks about our everyday consumption.  Without knowing exactly what will happen looking into the future, I am hopeful that more people will find a balance between enjoying a comfortable life and reevaluating the things we consume.  
<br><br>
The concept of minimalism was actually nothing new to me.  In high school, seniors were required to take a course called “Morality and Social Justice” where I had a teacher that would constantly lecture about how evil advertisements are and how buying into consumerism ultimately sets us up for failure.  We had to do endless projects analyzing the different mechanisms corporations would use to draw in an audience and convince them to buy a product that was essentially unnecessary.  Since this class, I have constantly questioned the life I am living and the things I consume.  Before I make any purchase,  watch any advertisement, or even check my phone, I remind myself of how it is imperative to find a balance amongst all these societal distractions.  I was fortunate enough to be able to take this class in high school and have the teacher that I did because it truly changed my life for the better.  Had I not taken this class, I fully believe I would’ve looked down upon the concept of minimalism as a whole.  Going forward after watching this documentary, I will hopefully continue to seek a balance between living a comfortable life and being aware of the fact that materialism will not always bring joy into my life.

I really enjoyed the documentary “Minimalism.” I think it’s so amazing that these people have been able to give up the majority of their consumer possessions, something that most of our country could not even fathom. I look around my double in IV and even in this very small space I see so many items that I never use or that I only keep around for sentimental value. Even still, I know I couldn’t bring myself to give up most of it. I consider myself to be more eco-conscious and minimalistic than many people I know, but I still hold onto my material belongings so much more strongly than the makers of this documentary. That is what concerns me about our future. If everyone were to give up material possessions and move into tiny houses, of course our planet would be far better off. Unfortunately, it is the extreme minority that actually has the willpower and ability to let go like those portrayed in this documentary. I would love to say that in the future I see myself moving into a tiny house and only owning what I need. Still though, the allure of a more grandiose lifestyle is painted in a more positive light in my mind. It’s much easier to praise others for letting go of consumerism than to actually imagine myself doing the same. 
<br><br>
Another part of the documentary that really hit me was when they brought up the personal storage industry. We really have so much useless stuff that a whole multi-million dollar industry is dedicated to keeping it locked away when we have no where else to put it. I find this disturbing and saddening. While my family is still more consumerist than the makers of the documentary, we still live a relatively minimal life compared to the rest of the country. Recently, every-time my mom goes to the grocery store she has been dropping something off at the thrift store, even if it’s just one item. If everyone were to practice this small-scale minimalism I think the need for the personal storage industry would go down. 
<br><br>
A final realization I had while watching this movie is that the minimalist movement still caters to the wealthier people in society. It is those that have enough money that have the freedom and time to reflect on what they need, what they don’t, and spend time away from work to downsize their life. Furthermore, sustainable living can appear to be expensive. Many sustainable clothing brands that I have come across have their cheapest items set around $80. Many vegan alternatives are more expensive than their dairy or meat counterparts. When working class people are just focusing on getting by, I think the freedom to explore sustainable living seems far less attainable. I think an important movement would be to show others that sustainable living actually can be cheaper and to put less of a white upper-class face to the concept of minimalism.

As I watched this film and they spoke about delusional craving of more I felt targeted. Not too long ago I upgraded from my old phone to the most recent one. I do not know why I did it when my old phone worked perfectly fine. Wait I do know why, because I felt as if I was left behind by having an older version. I know I am not the only one which is what causes the problem. There are thousands of people who have thought the same way. If it wasn’t when buying a phone it was when buying a new sweater. This mentality is what causes the problem of compulsory consumption. We are wired at such a young age to want things we did not need or actually want. I remember as a kid going to the store with my parents and coming out with a toy. A toy that I did not truly want before but after seeing it in the store it made me think that I wanted. A toy that I only played with the first few days and was later forgotten by me. These advertisements are everywhere and target all ages. 
 <br><br>
 I admire these minimalists as they are doing something that I do not think I can do. I am a hogger. I can not seem to let go of things. They go around for months with just a few items. While we can not go months without buying something new. We crave a new item of clothing. I myself find myself shopping for the fun of it. “Wow I haven't bought anything in a while, let me do some shopping,” knowing I have perfectly good clothes in my closet, some with even the tags on. It is sad to see how brainwashed we are to these materials.

Watching the film “Minimalism”, I was instantly captured by the plot, and how living such a minimal lifestyle can be so much more beneficial. I thought this film was so much more eye-catching than anything i've watched before, as it took such a looked down upon culture and brought it into the light. Minimalism is something that I personally feel has been rejected due to its nature, with a majority of people thinking that it would never be enough for them, and therefore they shouldn't do it.
<br><br>
I believe that the film did a great job of conveying to watcher the destructive and meaningless nature of always wanting more than they need. Whether it be food, clothes, or precious desires we could never get enough of it. Even though it may make us feel comfortable or make us “happy” in the moment, it is clear to me now that these things cannot bring true happiness. 
<br><br>
To be honest, before I had watched the film or done any of the readings, I thought that living a minimal lifestyle would be so hard and destructive. After doing this week's readings and film watching, it made it so much clearer to me that it wouldn't be that difficult. It was so heartwarming  to see in the film how much happier the lifestyle made the people who were interviewed. Even when talking to the people that lived in the tiny houses, one person that caught my eye was the woman who was diagnosed with MS and moved to the tiny house to minimize her symptoms. 
<br><br>
 Although when watching the film, it was a little harder to understand how I can actually achieve a minimalist lifestyle. Although the movie did a phenomenal job at conveying why it is so much more beneficial to live a minimalist lifestyle, but it never really explained how. Granted, I believe that their is so much more information online, but I think it would have added a great deal of significance for watchers

After watching the movie minimalist, I was able to truly understand the concept and the reason as to why these people find freedom. As mentioned in the film, most people have the mindset to but something which only brings them temporary happiness so they go buy something else creating a constant cycle. Additionally, this bring unnecessary necessities. Cluttering peoples life without them even notice in it. When most people picture minimalist, they picture someone with nothing and think why would i want to live like that. But what they dont realize is that minimalist have everything they most value.
<br><br>
Minimalism does not mean getting rid of everything you own. Minimalism is getting rid of the things that clutter you mind, space, and home. The film goes over how many times they are told that there are just somethings that people cant part with because it obviously brings value in their life. Minimalism is about keeping these items. These items are part of what truly makes you happy and if it brings happiness then you shouldn’t have to part from them. Keeping the items that bring you value and getting rid of everything else that’s unnecessary is what minimalism is about. Only this way can one truly be happy.

Materialism is something that I have been trying to step away from over the past few years. Growing up, I didn’t realize all of the destructive consequences of the fast fashion industry, but in becoming a conscious consumer, my eyes have been opened to all of the environmental damages and human rights violations made by the industry. I agree that being wrapped up in “the hunt” for the latest product or newest trend is making people miserable. Consumerism operates in such a way that allows trends to cycle in and out of style constantly, so that when someone invests in the trend and buys said item, it has already gone out of style and the customer is left feeling dissatisfied. The constant chase for the elusive “cool new thing” is exhausting and pointless - it has gotten to a point where people are buying things that they don’t even want or need, but purchase anyway because it’s on sale or they think they might use it in the future. From my experience, social media has exacerbated this problem on a global scale. Social media stars and instagram influencers have greatly contributed to this consumerist lifestyle because of how they amass large followings on their platforms and then use them to advertise brands to their followers. This is a very shallow and irresponsible way to use one’s platform when there are many other important issues that can be brought to people’s attention. Compulsory consumption is a futile venture, as none of these material goods will ever fulfill the roles we want them to. Instead, I feel that turning to minimalism would lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling lifestyle because we won’t be weighed down by tons of items that we don’t want or need. Although it will be harder for some people to turn to minimalism than others, we all can benefit from cutting some extra stuff out of our lives. We should also turn to other alternatives instead of the fast fashion industry, such as thrift stores and upcycled fashion. There is an incredibly large amount of unused clothing in the world that can be donated or recycled into newer pieces, and it is unnecessary and irresponsible to continue producing products and clothing at the rate that we do when it leaves such a massive impact on the environment.

Having watched “Minimalism” last quarter in English 22 I have to say that honestly I enjoyed it more than I did “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism.” While it is not completely fair to compare two short youtube videos to an actual film I will say that overall “Minimalism” was more effective at convincing me to consider my consumption that the other videos. All three of these videos touched on how limiting our consumption would improve our lives through logical and emotional appeals, which helped them to be quite persuasive. The one thing I did enjoy about the two youtube videos that was not featured in the film was the idea that minimalism, while great on a personal scale, is not enough to make a difference without concurrent policy change. The youtube videos also took more of an environmental approach than “Minimalism,” but it is obvious that the suggestions for minimalism made in the film also have great benefits for the environment. 
<br><br>
While I did somewhat enjoy the situation proposed in “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” it is hard to see it being anything other than a fantasy, at least in America. It is of course amazing to consider the possibility of a shorter work week with more job opportunities but it is hard to imagine that any corporations would seriously consider putting the environment, or even the well being of their employees, above their obsession with wealth. Every time that anyone I know loses hours at work they are more terrified about paying their bills than relieved that they have free time to innovate. Although this video suggests that people could retain the same pay with less work it seems unlikely that they would also receive the same benefits. I know that this is a pessimistic view and not the intended reaction for the video but it hard for me to imagine such a shift in culture because everyday people are not the people in the position to make these types of changes. Despite working class people making up the majority of the country, the few people in charge unfortunately seem to hold quite a bit of power. I agree with the need for a plenitude economy and appreciate the concept, but I am unsure that America in particular will ever adopt this forward thinking model. 
<br><br>
“The High Price of Materialism” was more in line with “Minimalism” as it discussed the correlation between our unhappiness and our materialistic lifestyles and suggested some ways to change these habits. One suggestion made was to mute commercials to avoid advertisements which is actually one social change I have witnessed. Increasingly people have stopped paying any attention to commercials and instead find them more annoying than tempting. I was not surprised to learn that 150 billion dollars a year are spent on advertisements because advertisements are everywhere, but I was disappointed to learn this. Advertisements are constantly coming at us from every direction and what is especially concerning is that many advertising companies work to target children, who will then in turn beg their parents to buy them things. Children are obviously more susceptible targets because they are not thinking about their environmental impact, and they are too young to be at blame for simply wanting a new toy that is being waved in front of them by an advertising company. 
<br><br>
Overall it is concerning that we are so consumed by our need for material items. Everyone has been guilty of falling victim to consumerism at some point in their life and no one will ever be perfect, but it can be beneficial for our own mental health and the planet’s health to practice at least some aspects of minimalism. Even if we cannot all personally make massive economic change, which is a somewhat unattainable and daunting goal in my opinion, we can make personal changes and encourage the people in our lives to do the same.

Minimalism was an extremely interesting and revealing film that has caused me to reflect upon my own lifestyle, beliefs, and habits. To be honest, I’m completely fascinated by the cultural movement of minimalism that has emerged. While I consider the culture of rampant consumerism Ken refers to as a rather recent phenomena as a result of capitalism and economic growth, I think that human societies have been materialistic for over a millennium. I know this is perhaps a rather bold statement and it probably depends on the way one chooses to look at history but here’s my point of view. Even in ancient Chinese civilizations, there was a clear divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots” and this societal hierarchy was established and displayed through material possessions. Over time, what you own — both quantity and quality — has come to represent your social class and wealth. Moreover, people seem to associate owning luxurious goods with wealth and more importantly, power. I think it’s also important to note that power is often grouped together with independence and the freedom to make your own choices (although I actually believe that no matter how much power or wealth one possesses, everyone deals with something that limits or stifles them). However, historically speaking, minimalism has also been around for a long time. Buddhism is perhaps a good example of this. 
<br><br>
I think that the idea of voluntary minimalism being a tool that can assist you in finding freedom to be extremely noteworthy because I think most people, since the dawn of civilization, it seems, have pursued success, power, and wealth in order to obtain their freedom. Therefore, we have no opposite ways of living who both ultimately have the same ideal, the same goal.  

<br><br>
Finally, I would like to reiterate that voluntary minimalism as a way of life and potential solution to help alleviate the climate crisis is in fact a First World conundrum. With that said, I’m not sure I completely agree with Tim Kasser’s idea that materialism itself makes us less happy and more anxious, depressed, and selfish. I’d like to think that what we choose to own and buy, for the most part, doesn’t have much bearing on the type of person that we choose to be and become. Also, with regards to climate change, I think that personal changes such as a minimalist lifestyle are a fabulous start but if we really want to save our planet, large scale economic, cultural, and political changes will be necessary.

There is one sentence that touched me well after I watched the film “Minimalism a documentary about the important things”. “I tried to fill up the void in the same way many people do, with stuff, lots of stuff. I was filling the void with consumer purchases.” This sentence depicts the scenario most people are facing now. Do not know when to begin, earning a lot of money and buying whatever you want are a tag for successful people. Therefore, people are craving for consumption. But, is it true that stuff could bring us happiness? The movie gives us the answer—no. The mainstream concept of consumption is whether or not that product is functional or just aesthetic, as long as one has a passion for it, he should buy it regardless of the cost of the product in that the consumption capability is the representation of status, which is perfectly falling into the consumption trap the companies set. Companies usually allocate most of their resources on dropping in advertisements to promote their products and stimulate the consumption. People usually are fooled by those commercials and buy things on an impulse to get the temporary happiness for possessing the product they are longing for. But as time passes, the wearing off the novelty to the product will decrease the happiness one possesses.  Then at some point, when the novelty disappears completely, one will pursue the next product he is interested in to obtain the temporary happiness again. Minimalism, a totally opposite concept of consumption, encourages people to buy the things that are really necessary and meaningful to them, rather than buying things that are popular.  Minimalism promotes proper consumption rather than over-consumption, buying things that are really useful in daily life could help one get ride of the anxiety the over-consumption brought. In this way, the role of the money is no longer the indispensable goal in one’s life and one can allocate some spare time to do some meaningful things to truly fill up the void in their life rather than stucking in a vicious circle: making money, buying things and then  making more money.  Minimalism does not ask one to be careless anything; instead, it is calling for people to care about things that are really worthy for them to care. Sometimes, having too many things is really a burden and pressure for one.

A plenitude economy sounds great. It is hard to imagine it in the U.S. because of the cultural value we place on work and even excessive work as a good thing that one will be rewarded for. Looking to other countries like the Netherlands, we can see that this is not just an ideal, but a viable economic system. It is incredibly frustrating that we are fed this idea that our material wealth is indicative of our success and that our measure of success has nothing to do with mental well being or happiness. To meet the material wealth goal we have been fed, many of us work excessively, neglecting relationships and self care. Our culture does not prize a day off to rest like they prize an all nighter. Our system does not support balance. In fact, our system has lead to an incredible imbalance as the richest 5% of people in the U.S. control 65% of the country's wealth. It seems that we can solve this climate crisis and also live happier lives. Placing so much value on material goods makes us less happy. If we prioritize balance and social capital, we can live happier lives, improve our economy, and save the planet. In "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy," they outline that while technological growth is an awesome part of solving the climate crisis, it is only a small part because growth degrades planetary resources. This is important to remind people of as many ignore their personal habits and look to things like renewable energy sources as the ultimate solution. We can not get out of this climate mess without some serious reflection (called for by Thoreau), and some big social and political changes. The climate crisis represents a large scale imbalance and solving it will require us to change many things for the better.

Before watching the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” I have heard the term “minimalism” for several years and thought it is just a lifestyle chosen by a group of people. I never know that it has such benefits. I always have a thought that the more stuff you have, the happier you are. But after I have watched the film, I realized that it actually not. Buying a pair of shoes would make you happy, but buy the second would not. Nowadays, people are mostly trapped by consumerism, which we are buying a lot of thing that are not necessarily needed. And I was shocked when the film said that we have 52 seasons a year for clothing, which is really the trap of the consumerism.
</p><hr>

<p>
For people to start changing they need a succes story, a personal experience that positively surprises them. Form the outside minimalism is not that appealing at all. Living like you do now with less stuff, why would you do that. To make this appealing people need to actually experience it, that or either get scared of the consequences of climate change so much that they make a radical change. I actually think it is quite possible to evoke change by making people think about the benefits of minimalism. If we want people to consider cutting back on consuming the number one motivated should not be saving money. Because saving money usually has only one purpose and that is spending it on something else. The main focus should be on battling  depression and stress, clearing your mind, health benefits and general benefits of not having a lot of stuff. It is a long way of but if people believe in something because they intrinsically motivated to do it they are way more likely to actually do it opposed to if they are extrinsically motivated (i.e. by money). People need to feel results rather than physically getting them in the form of more money or stuff.

<p>
In the documentary "Minimalism" it displays a lifestyle on one end of the spectrum with the lifestyle of extreme consumerism on the opposite end. I like how the documentary shines a light on part of the fashion industry that tries to invent new styles, put them in style and make them popular, and then a week later make that style out of fashion and bring in something new. This is a play to try to keep people consuming and feeling unsatisfied with what people have now. It reminded me of how Apple will throttle the speed and battery life of the older generation iPhone when a new one is released to make the consumer base unsatisfied with their current phone and more inclined to buy the new iPhone. Advertisers are in the business of promoting the cycle of unsatisfied-consumption-satisfied-unsatisfied and its clear it's in their best interest to keep shortening this cycle. I feel like it's important for people to recognize when they are being advertised to and ask themself is this product really of any additional utility or is it just a marketing gimmick that preys on careless consumers. While I think the lifestyle of Joshua and Ryan are admirable I don't think it's necessary for everyone to adopt their lifestyle and I don't think that's their message but rather their goal is to send the message that your happiness is not tied to your possessions and having less doesn't mean you will be unhappy, to be a more careful consumer, and to live within your means.

<p>
It was a very interesting documentary but I have strong doubts that a minimalist lifestyle could ever one day be a mainstream way of life in todays world, especially in America, a very materialistic place. They way we are geared as humans in today's society is to go to school so we can get good jobs. We want good jobs so we can make more money, and we want more money so we can afford more luxuries. Obviously, this is not the rule for everyone, but that is generally how our society is geared. And what we have at any given moment is never fully satisfactory because we can always aspire to have more. It is hard for me to imagine us collectively transitioning from this mindset to one of a minimalist.

This film made me realize a lot about my lifestyle and how many things I could easily be doing differently. 
<br><br>
First of all, before I came to UCSB, I lived by myself and had so many pieces of furniture and unnecessary stuff just because I liked the idea of having my own things-no matter how many things it was-and in my own place. This film, along with other epiphanies I've had during this course, I am realizing that all that junk only caused me a lot of stress and headache. Now that I live in university housing with four other girls in a super small space, I realize having less feels so much better. I can't even remember half of the stuff I got rid of. Second of all, not only have I realized how much easier life is with less things, I also just feel more relaxed and free-it's hard to explain. It's sad that we live in culture that is so invested in the idea of things...You grow up living in a world of advertisements and influence, that it's hard to not think anything is wrong with the way most of America is living...
</p><hr>

<p>
When I first saw the title of the movie, I felt really confused because I have never heard about minimalism before. At first, the movie describes the consumption ways that people have changed n America over a period of time and then introduces tow people who used to eared really high wages which were seemed as happiness, but these two men change their life styles into minimalism which means they only keep the important and necessary things in their lives. In this way, they also wrote a book to tell more people about minimalism. In their words, minimalism is not the way that try to discard everything, it is the attitude towards what is important to you and try to avoid useless action. In my view, maybe we do not need to be a minimalism totally, maybe we just need to stand in the middle and learn how to consume as a minimalism which is buy the thing that really matter without any waste. Not only consumption, but also a lot of things. One of people in the movie got a really high position in a bank which can be described as a successful guy. However, what he earned will give him more burden which will let him lose his true life, the life that he chased for. Due to the millions of attractive advertisements, it is hard for most people to control their consumption which cause tons of waste in America and all around the world. In short, it is significant to take action for all of us to try to consume like a minimalist.

Of all the films I've watched this class, this one has by far been my favorite.  
<br><br>
I already consider myself to be someone who tries not to let myself fall into the consumerism trap, especially fast fashion and like the movie showed, the newest and best models of phones and tablets.  I own about 3 drawers of clothes, including pants, shirts, underwear, socks, and jackets, yet even this at times feels like too much.  I find value in the fact that most of my clothes have been hand-me-downs or thrifted and it was cool to see this reflected in the movie.  
<br><br>
One of the things that stood out to me the most in the film was Ryan was discussing how he was selling phones to 5-year-olds, and that's when he looked at his life and thought, what am I doing?  this made me think and look into my life and my ideals towards the world.  I feel the happiest and most at peace when I am out in nature, and out surfing.  this movie made me realize that it is during these times is when I am the most detached from the world.  the only thing that I have is my wetsuit (or just a bikini if I'm surfing in warm water) and my board.  the only thing that matters is the people I am surfing with and the beauty of being outside and enjoying the company of my friends and what the world has to offer.  I think that minimalism is definitely a viable and meaningful option.  I don't think that you have to go as extreme as they do from the start, you don't need to leave your job and everything behind to live in a tiny house (though I feel like I already lived in one after living in the dorms, but they are super cool and would be a cool option in the future!), but I think everyone can do good from disconnecting a bit from the superficial world and the want of bigger and better, and focus more on meaningful relationships with people and enjoying the little things that the world has to offer.

 I also find that most of the things in my closet tend to come second-hand or from thrift stores, but I still find it hard to justify the sheer quantity. I stay away from fast fashion, but how much of an impact does it truly make if I'm still amassing an anything-but-small collection of clothing?

Watching this video did also make me reflect about my potential progression keeping the information I learned in mind. I have never wanted to go into any aspect of business because of inherent ideals of mine, but it also made me think about the subliminal ways in which our work can contribute towards our toxic culture of consumerism; for example, simply the 8 hour a day, 5 day a week work schedule that is so typical encourages profit maximization, leaving folks exhausted, but surrounded by their favorite things.

I have heard of the Minimalism documentary so having to watch it for Hiltner’s class was something I was looking forward to. When I first watched the film I felt like living a minimalistic life was something that seemed easily attainable and it made sense because I know that ones’ happiness does not equate to how much money you are spending or how much stuff you have. I grew up in what Hiltner would say is a nonvoluntary minimalistic household, but after watching the documentary I want to live a voluntary minimalistic life because I already have that background and it would be easy to translate that into my adult life. I believe like vegetarianism, minimalism can help make a big impact when it comes to people's carbon footprint and countries' CO2 emissions. I know that just living a minimalistic life on its own won’t make that big enough impact, but it has to go hand in hand with other lifestyle changes and altogether that is whereas a country we will be able to see those necessary changes for the better when it comes to the climate crisis. Something that frustrates me as a person is I know these are all good hypothetical situation, but I feel like the American people have had this way of living so ingrained into their lives that it will be hard to try and get enough people to change their way of living in time to help change the outcomes of the climate crisis. All in all, I am a total advocate for the minimalistic lifestyle, as a society we need to see that consumerism will not make us happy, in fact, it makes us miserable and we should take the necessary action to change for the better as individuals and as a country.

Minimalism was great at conveying the benefits of minimalism and showing how different people across the world utilize minimalism to live their lives. Because of the mass amount of overconsumption in society, minimalism is greatly needed. In America and other Western countries, compulsive consumption is a serious problem. Once a new product comes out, people often throw away their older but functioning product in order to get their hands on the new, trendy product. Society’s perspective on material goods must be changed in order to live in a more sustainable world. By adopting a minimalistic way of living life, the amount of material goods one buys would be cut down drastically. 
<br><br>
I liked how the film showed us various ways to live a minimalist lifestyle and personal experiences from people living the minimalist life. It made me rethink the amount of purchases I make in a year, and I feel pretty guilty to admit that I go on shopping sprees pretty often. After watching this film, I will definitely cut down on the amount of material purchases I make in a year.

The video “Visualizing a plenitude economy” starts off by stating that in the 70’s scientists predicted that the effects of the overuse of the planet resources by humans would surface in the 20th century. They were right. With that being said I don’t understand how people in the 21st century are still in denial about what scientists have to say in regards to the climate crisis. Their predictions were accurate back then when they didn’t have the technology we have today so it frustrating to see how people are still in denial. The film introduces the idea of a plenitude economy in which people change how they spend their time in hopes that it will make an environmental impact while also creating new jobs. The idea of working only 30 hours a week sounds nice, what guarantees us that people will actually use this extra time to improve the way they live in an environmentally conscious way? With that being said I do believe that many people find themselves working extra hours or two jobs just to make ends meet so although the idea of a plenitude economy comes with the benefits of working less and retiring early, I do not think it would work in America where 200 million people are in debt already. However, if this type of economy was implemented I do believe that change would occur for future generations but it would be a difficult transition for many especially those who are already in debt. The video “The high price of materialism” speaks about the effects of consumerism and materialism on people's lives. Scientists have found that as materialism goes up pro social values go down and people stop caring about the environment and how their purchases are affecting it. The film also speaks on the health effects materialism has on people; depression, anxiety, drug abuse.  
<br><br> 
Although I do believe that we can maximize minimalism by building our society on less materialistic values, I think it would be an extremely difficult thing to do as a great majority of people base their happiness on material things. For instance a saying I see on social media every now and then when the topic of working hard for materialistic reasons is brought up is “okay but would you rather be crying in your range rover or under a bridge?” Although this is an extreme comparison, sadly our generation would much rather work their entire life for more material things  and temporary happiness because of the fear of not being “successful” and having nothing. But who says that those who have a lot are happier than those who don’t have much to begin with?

In the two videos, both point out the high cost of materialism, which does not fulfill happiness and life satisfaction but may even create more depression and anxiety. Media is an essential factor that affects and encourage audiences the stereotype that consuming lifestyle makes you happy and enjoyable. However, when materialistic values go up, the pro-social values and intrinsic values go down. People focus more on goods and materials rather than engaging ecologically beneficial activities and the relationships within the community. Besides, the movies suggest a new economic model, a plentitude economy, which change the way we spend our time and reduce environmental impact at the same time. People have fewer work times per week, which people tend to consume less, and this change allows more opportunities for low-impact economic activity and social connections, such as sharing, borrowing, growing vegetables, and recycling. This new economic model permits a fairer distribution of work and income, which encourages a balance between inequality of the rich and poverty in the nation, and more people get jobs. 
<br><br>
 According to the videos, the research shows that people prioritize materialistic values they feel insecure. The government and locals should promote intrinsic values such as volunteer works, meaningful work that assess citizens’ well-being, and a sense of connection to communities, which strengthens one’s sense of security in society. Additionally, the government should limit the display of advertisement form public areas, especially children’s schools. Minimalism is an excellent approach to save our planet and promote one’s inner manner and also release stress and burden for having so many stuff or things going on. Even though I can not minimize the things I already have, I will try to live my life toward minimalism since I think this is such a great approach.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the short films "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy," and "The High Price of Materialism" the narrators successfully describe and explain the harms of our consumerist society, and how this way of life is harmful to our overall well-being. I think that it is very important that they explained how materialism does not improve our quality of life, and in fact impairs it. We can see in these videos that a minimalist way of life would not only be very beneficial to the environment, but it would also make us happier. This is clearly a win-win situation, however this transition from consumerist to minimalist would be extremely difficult, especially in the United States. American people are extremely attached to this lifestyle and to the belief that the more you have, the more successful you are. While this change would be great for everyone, and I definitely believe that we should all do our best to implement these ideals into our lives as often as possible, I am quite pessimistic when hoping for a significant population to make this change in their lives. However I do believe that there are certain ways, as shown in these videos, that we can start to make this change, such as trying to mask our exposure to ads.

We live in a maximalist society, we are encouraged to buy more, consume more, and produce more. The entire basis of capitalism is producing as many goods as possible at the cheapest price point. This appeals to basic human nature of wanting and having stuff. There is a new trend of minimalism that is mainstream right now and this documentary highlights this growing trend and how easy it is to actually achieve the minimalist lifestyle the planet needs. 
<br><br>
If we as Americans consume less it would be a massive step towards reducing global carbon emissions. In my own life, I have found myself wanting the newest model of a computer or phone and I do try to curb my consumption by only getting a new phone or computer when my current item has given out. But it is hard to escape the desire to own stuff, even stuff you don't need. Even in modern minimalist architecture buildings are filled with more technology than ever leading to my point that even minimalism has become a bastardized version of itself merely hiding wastefulness rather than reducing it.
</p><hr>

<p>
In Korean culture - at least those back at my home town - it is popular to show off wealth by having the nicest designer clothes and luxury cars. It encourages others to buy more than the person next to them. Because of this I have been exposed to extreme maximalism. The sad thing is, that many of these people aren’t even extremely wealthy, they just spend their money on things that they think will make them look good, which is stressful, and I can imagine that it makes people upset and sad. I don’t know if anyone will realize that their happiness may lie in having less stuff. It is so depressing to see people live in tiny, dingy homes and spend all their money on a Mercedes and designer purses and clothes because that is how people will perceive them in public. Not only does minimalism have a positive impact on the environment, but if more people became minimalist, it would normalize it and encourage people to not fake their wealth by buying more things but embracing what they have in moderation. This will lessen buying unnecessary items AND lessen the burden and stress of always having to buy new things. 

<br><br>
Seeing so many minimalists living great lifestyles really encourages me to get rid of the stuff I have and minimize my life!
</p><hr>

<p>
Minimalism is an a lot more attractive concept than it sounds like. I feel as if people who prioritize personal or spiritual fulfillment above material wealth are far far happier. I believe that the Buddhist religion is a fine example of minimalistic benefits. Those who are able to be satisfied without chasing objects are able to live much higher lives. Unfortunately, widespread institutions have instilled a desperate desire for material goods in most Americans. Minimalism and other ideologies that are beneficial for the environment need to be for lack of better words "made cool". I do not know if it is possible to subvert consumerism, as it is so deeply ingrained in society, but if minimalism is popularized it would go such a long way towards slowing our destruction of the planet. 
<br><br>
I am glad Ken mentioned Sweden as an example because I think that they have made great progress in changing cultural norms like excessive work weeks that reinforce consumerism. People need to slow down and realize that there is far more to life than socioeconomic status. While my family visited Stockholm last may, we noticed that people seemed happier despite knowing that the average salary is not all that high. I think that future generations of parents need to raise their kids differently, in a way that doesn't subliminally inculcate materialism into children. I was raised in a way that made me believe that possession of money and lots of things was the easiest way to feel happy but I really do not feel that way anymore. I am now in a position where I would feel guilty if I fully indulged in materialism without even trying to consider the ecological consequences of my actions. This film shed a light on a perspective that I think is very healthy for our world today. Even if one cannot fully evolve into a life of minimalism, at least moving in that direction would go along way. I think people really need to consider the way they feel when purchasing things. If people question the sense of fulfillment they attain from buying material things they will hesitate to continue the cycle. I have realized that I do not feel that much happier after making a big purchase of a new clothing item or phone or whatever else. I have just been taught to expect satisfaction from consumption and never thought to question that relationship until recently. I feel lucky to be taking this class before I enter adulthood because the way I go about my life will be vastly different after learning new things and being exposed to ideas like Minimalism

Watching the documentary, especially seeing the Black Friday footage of people rushing in maniacally to grab items on sale, made me feel so embarrassed about U.S. society. We really are so materialistic, but with all of the pressure from media depicting how our lives should be, I also don’t blame people for chasing after that materialistic, lavish life. Just like how people are polluting the earth, advertising has polluted the people to do so as said by one of the people featured in the documentary. 
<br><br>
Minimalism, letting go of all the materialistic, unneeded or excess possessions. Josh, a minimalist, speaks about how each material item he has, has value and if it doesn’t not bring him happiness or have important value, he is willing to let go and this lifestyle has brought him happiness. Growing up in a society where it was normal to want material items such as toys, and the latest phone, and nice looking clothes, watching this documentary also made me feel really bad and really guilty. To give up all my possession that I don’t need would honestly be a huge struggle for me. But as Thoreau also talked about, a simplistic lifestyle seems to be happier and healthier for the Earth. I know it will be hard to break the materialistic cycle that we are born into. After hearing that one of the people in the documentary had to sell phones to 5 year olds in order to get a bigger paycheck and therefore live a bigger and nicer life, I thought about how sad it was. How it was expected of him to climb the corporate ladder and to have bigger and more expensive things and targeting a 5 year old was just one thing he had to do to get that raise. And now that 5 year old is going to most likely follow that cycle of climbing ladders and materialism. 
<br><br>
If people are going to turn to a minimalist life, I feel like it would have to be done gradually instead of cold turkey. I just hope that our generation can be the start of breaking that materialistic cycle and that we do have enough time to start associating the “American dream” or goal in life to be more minimalist instead of rich.

I enjoyed this documentary because it’s a film about a potential solution to our rampant consumerist culture. Being in this class has helped me become more aware of the influence that rampant consumerism has on our society. This film shows us yet another way to reduce our carbon footprint. The best part of this minimalist movement -besides its positive environmental impact - is that minimalism can have other potential health benefits. From the physical to the social aspects of our lives, minimalism can have an amazing effect on us. 
<br><br>
I would love to see it, a society that isn’t influenced by rampant consumerism. I don’t want to be a hypocrite, I find myself influenced by this culture, and the voice in the back of my head knows exactly the consequences of my actions - yet I find myself ignoring it. For the past year, I have tried to reduce my meat intake and influence those around me to do the same. Fortunately, I have been party successful as I completely cut out meat from my diet and my heavily meat eating family eats meat probably twice a month. This is what I want to do with my rampant consumerism - but I’ve had a more difficult time transitioning into a sustainable consumer. 
<br><br>
That being said doesn't mean I will stop trying. I want to live a life that I will be proud of living. I don’t want to look back when I’m older and realize that I’ve worked my entire life in competition with others - over “ bigger and better things”. I want to be as reasonably sustainable as I can, and I’m so glad UCSB has classes like these. I’m learning so much about the environment and how our culture is having such a huge impact on it.
</p><hr>

<p>
I honestly loved this film. I think it is so important to provoke thought and reflection in each other especially in terms of consumption. A lot of people get stuck on the conveyor belt of what society tells us to want, pursue, and do with our lives. The only way to fully extract the experience of this life is to make each other reflect and start discussions about how we are living and the consequences of our actions. 
<br><br>
I do believe that it is a little unrealistic to get everyone on board with living in a small house. People should find their own balance of what works for them and their family. I really like what the father was saying about ultimately letting their children make their own decisions and just doing their best as parents to set a good example. Climate crisis and minimalism aside that is just fantastic parenting. It is so important to educate the next generation on issues rather than just order them and tell them how to live just to ultimately despise that lifestyle. Having kids choose minimalism is way more powerful and beneficial than a child being forced into it. 
<br><br>
This video is thought-provoking and forces self-reflection and I am glad that it is in the world. The video shots of black Friday was what really stuck with me. Even traveling to other countries that is the image other countries have of Americans. That we are just greedy materialistic people with an eternal want. It’s so silly because things are ultimately just things. Even just recognizing that children are being targeted is mind-blowing and scary since they are still so young and impressionable.

Although I could not a hundred percent agree with the documentary “Minimalism”, it really resonates a lot with me. Nowadays, the most important evaluation of successful for a person is the level of wealthy. As more and more media are posting the luxurious and voluptuous life of the celebrities and wealthier, the public starts to pursue this kind of lives and object them as life goals. To be honest, sometimes myself also fall into obsession to these living style when I see them in the internet. Indeed, trying to gain a wealthier life is one of the life goals of most people, and there is no reason that this is wrong. However, while people are working hard to achieve this goal, they might forget their original purpose, which is living happier. Many people will forget and ignore their beloveds and their loving things when they are struggling on the path to wealth. It is inevitable that people will have more annoyance and lose what they have already possessed when they are seeking a wealthier life. Imagine a person work very diligently and arduously throughout his entire life and finally become a rich man when he is old, but he finally finds out he has nothing besides money. Isn't this sadly and pathetic? 
<br><br>
In my opinion, keeping and protecting what we loved and care about is the most important thing to do, instead of making more money and getting more and bigger stuff. It is true that we need to earn money to get a life we want, but it is important to remember money is only a number, a tool to make our life better. Once we have enough of money to support our life, we should not let it affect and annoy ourself. How to confirm the amount of money and things that we needed? I believe Minimalism is the best way. It tells us what we really need and can prevent some meaningless and unnecessary things from distracting and controlling our life. The reason why some people are unsatisfied with their life while they already have enough money and belongs is they have been attracted by many things they don’t possess. People’s desire and wants are unlimited. Once they have something they will want more. If they don’t get it, they will feel distressed, which will ruin their lives. The key to a happy life is to control our lust and focus on what we really loved and needed, and I believe being a minimalist can help us achieve this goal.

A quote that really stood out to me during this film was ”as humans we are wired to become dissatisfied”. As a culture, we are programmed to always be moving on to the next thing. Whether its cars, fashion trends, or new technology, we are never satisfied for long. I felt like I could relate to the constant feeling of discontentment that comes with chasing new products in the hopes of finding some fleeting satisfaction. After watching this documentary, I felt inspired to take a look at my relationship with stuff. The first thing that I did while sitting in the library immediately after watching, was I went through my phone and deleted all of the apps I no longer use. It was a very small and probably insignificant action, but it made me realize how much “stuff” I had on my phone that was just taking up space. Then I started to imagine how much stuff I have sitting in my closet and under my bed that is also just taking up space. Looks like I have some cleaning to do. Not only does trying to implement a more minimalist lifestyle make people feel more satisfied with what they have, it can have a great impact on reducing our environmental footprint. Promoting the minimalist ideals to make it more widespread would be a way to start the cultural shift that needs to happen in order to reduce the compulsive consumer mindset in our society.

After I finished watching the film “Minimalism,” I started to pounder. I am so impressed by Joshua’s condition, like how little he possessed, and then I compared him with my condition, like how much I possessed, and I found out that I am much luckier than many people. I used to feel that buying new clothes or shoes can makes me feel happy, because my friends would complement me. However, after I brought these items, I wear them very often for first three weeks, but after that, I’ve never wear them, even as pajama, and I still keep buying them, like I didn’t have enough clothes. However, after I watched this film, I start to wonder, “Do I really need that much clothes?” I walked to my wardrobe and I found that many clothes are still wearable to me, but I only wear them for a short time. Then I started to consider that why not be a minimalist? Not only dose it save many money, but also I contribute a part to educe climate crisis.

Even in the 70s’ there are researchers saying that the resources on Earth are going to be overused at the beginning of the 21st century, and people were not making any actions, ore even they were, there was just a little of them. In that situation, the rich got richer and the poor got even poorer, the gap between the rich and the poor becomes bigger and bigger. This is a bad cycle, which the gap leads to a worse “ecological overshoot”, which, then, again leads to another expansion of the gap. I find the solution the video, Visualize a plentitude economy, is talking about really helpful. When a company provides jobs to 5 people instead of 4 people, and their workload will be less, which gives them more time to grow their own vegetables, or as the video said, “canning and brewing beer … generating energy, sewing clothing, and even making manufactured items with desktop-sized computer-controlled machines.” which will significantly help the “workload” the Earth has. Not only the environment gets better, but also the situation of the lack of job opportunities gets better as well. In this video, the professor is talking about that minimalism is not just for the environmental reason as those two people in the film, minimalism, has said; it is more for the person him/herself. People have less struggle and pressure, and etc. And by freeing ourselves from all of those negative things, we can also benefit the earth, isn’t that a good lifestyle to choose to follow? We buy what we really need to buy and give away or sell what we do not necessarily need, things are getting recycled and reused over time. Those are all the good things minimalism could bring us. Combining what the plentitude video is talking about, people could make the environmental problem less severe.

I actually read 10% happier, Dan Harris's book, when I was in high school. My mental health was truly at an all time low. I found it a huge relief to go through everything I had and get rid of things I didn't use, and turn more toward meditating and entertaining myself inwardly. I was very good at that for a while, but I eventually fell out of the pattern due to the convenience and business of everything around me. It's so hard, when my brain has been coded since the beginning to crave constant stimulation, to accept that I don't actually need that continuous stream of input. It forced me to ask myself, why am I always bored? Underneath what I called boredom, there was actually a lot of unhappiness within myself and my thoughts, the things I would turn to when my brain went idle. That kind of stuff is hard to deal with, and it's much easier to cover it up with retail therapy.
<br><br>
Seeing that people can find so much pure joy and fulfillment by being deliberate and intentional about the things they own is inspiring. This lifestyle seems so unattainable, but there are so many things that each person can do to be more thoughtful about what they own. For example, after you read a book, think of a friend who would enjoy it and give it to them. Tell them to never give it back to you, but instead to pass it on to someone it reminds them of. You could each write a little note in it, and it becomes a special little log of who's had it. Having only enough dishes and silverware for the people in your home means that they won't stack up and overwhelm you to the point where cleaning feels daunting. The beauty and clarity of open space is actually fairly easy to obtain, piece by piece.

The film "Minimalism" introduced to me a movement which I did not know of its proper magnitudes. I had heard of tiny houses and thought of them as a very foreign way to live. I would watch those videos and think to myself that I could never do something like that and that I would get too claustrophobic, etc. Then, the Life Edited style apartment seemed to be the most reasonable way of the "tiny home." The way they designed the apartment was minimalist, modern, yet attractive, and seemed like the most reasonable style of a home for many followers to get behind. This moderate approach may be the key for a more minimalist lifestyle for ordinary people in the future, but this message must outweigh the many messages that support consumerism. Currently, America is in the biggest consumerist movement ever seen, which is constantly fueled by billions of dollars' worth of advertisements. This culture will likely continue for some time until climate change is collectively the biggest issue for the population. Until then, it is important to combat the ideals of excessive consumerism with this movement of minimalism. I thought the movie did a great job of identifying and explaining the benefits of the movement, but barely touched on how we will implement this worldwide. They also make it seem like there are two extremes: living with fiftyish items in a tiny home, or living in a wasteful mcmansion. Obviously, this is not valid, for there are many ways people live in between these two ways that are negative or positive to the environment. I think they should introduce a more rational way of living, which will give minimalism a bigger following and positively impact the Earth on a much greater level.

After watching the film, “Minimalism”. The film showcases the current consumer market we’re living in. As Dan Harris stated, “We spend so much in the hunt,making us miserable in the hunt…”. Our society is fabricated by the idea of American Dream, the concept that America is a land of opportunity in which if an individual works ‘hard enough’ they will achieve their dream and desires in life.But does American Dream fabricate the true concept of happiness? In today’s society, consumers seem to be confused about what is going to make them happy, they seem to be filling a void. Our consumption has drastically increased throughout the years. It is sad that our society is abusing our capitalistic view towards consumption. Nowadays, advertisement is reflecting a fake version of our reality, making us feel like we are out of trend, for the sake of their profitable desires. As seen in the film,  ‘rice and beans are more expensive than our clothes”, what are we really finding?, the film centralizes the question of ‘what really matters?’ or ‘what else do I need?’. Personally, I agree to the purpose of the film is trying to portray, like seriously, from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate the film because I could relate with their mentality of being a mentalist. I always belong to the 1% of simply limiting my expenses and consumption ever since I was a kid, whether that be because of my parents influential lifestyle to me or whether because I constantly ask my true value as a human being, the idea to be successful. Saving money and looking forward to ‘live the next day’ has always been my style.
<br><br>
In all honesty, I couldn’t escape the negative thought of comparing my lifestyle to others. I have always envied other students for having the latest of everything, from laptop, phones, Ipad, clothes, cars, and even their lavish lifestyles every weekend. As a first-gen student, I am completely financially independent and could relate to one of the speakers of the film when it comes to “living paycheck to paycheck”. It always seemed like I was striving to survive.Additionally, I could relate to the former Wallstreet broker in many ways as we had the same mindset, tackling the idea of American Dream. As a UCSB student, I promised myself and my family that I would have a successful career, and that I could achieve it if I find the most lucrative career which is Finance and Accounting. I realized as I was listening to his story that both of our stories are similar in a way that we allowed ourselves to ‘look for money’, the notion that we will be financially free if we chase money. As a result, we ended up hating ourselves, hating the choices we make because we are literally slaving for a paycheck. At that moment, I realized that money doesn’t buy happiness, on some cases sure it does, and it even buys your needs to survive, but not a single currency would be able to describe what you're truly passionate off. Additionally, I realized that we as a society live in a ‘system’, people will literally do anything for money. Specifically, people who hate their jobs and their current careers because they chased the concept of money, they are all being sold to the world of consumption and capitalism. The monetary, the material, and even the success, the thing you put value based on currency will never make you be fulfilled in life, because it never ends, it is an unending cycle, there will be no such thing as an amount of money that could make an individual stop if money is what they care about. Whether if its buying new clothes, new houses, new cars, lots of women or men around, and even success, if we centralize our world with money, we will never achieve our goals of saving the world, saving the environment, or saving ourselves. The whole capitalism and the idea of American dream is like a drug, it keeps calling you and it's going to keep you stuck in the hamster wheel. However, if we reverse engineer our mentality and the system together, towards appreciation and love, we may, perhaps, be able to save ourselves and the world.

I first saw "Minimalism" several years ago, when it was fairly new. Since then, I've avidly listened to the titular men's podcast, titled "The Minimalists Podcast" and read Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus's website, "The Minimalist." I would recommend two of their essays in particular: "The Commodification of Love", which is bookmarked on my computer, and "A Minimalist, a Japanese Cowboy, and an Arrogant American Walk into a Museum." Their other essays are well worth the read, as well, but these two have always been particularly powerful to me.
<br><br>
Instead of rewatching "Minimalism", I viewed "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism." I thought that the former was one of the most interesting films that I've watched for this class so far. The societal restructuring that a "plenitude economy" calls for seems almost inconceivable in American society; something like a 4-day work week seems almost antithetical to work ethic in the U.S. After all, it was a struggle to enact labor laws that protected our rights to an eight hour work day and weekly time off, something that is absent in people's lives today as we have to take on longer hours and multiple jobs to afford to survive. I also appreciated the criticism of economic growth as the solution to the climate crisis; the concept of economic growth is used as a catch-all problem solver in the U.S. I can't help but think of Edward Abbey's words: growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of a cancer cell. Like malignant cancer, the American lifestyle and the people who live it (that is now an international pandemic) are rapidly draining the life of our planet. While we may say that cancer wins when its host dies, the truth is that the cancer will die too.

<p>
In the film "Minimalism" we are given insight on the living a simple life that allows a greater chance of happiness. In the film I really liked that they gave multiple example of how to adapt minimalism into everyday life. For example a point was made that minimalism is similar to living a bachelorette lifestyle, and it becomes extremely harder as more people are considered in the household. I think its important that those who are fortunate enough to live this lifestyle try to adapt it in their everyday lives as much as they can. The married couple with children in the film had to compromise in order to live a balanced and well rounded life. The children are already being trained to let go of their possessions that no longer serve them. This will create further generations that are more conscious of their consumption and the impact it has on their well being. As mentioned in the film this has freed many people of the worries and the societal pressures they have endured throughout their entire lifetime. Also seeing how this has allowed other people to follow their true passions is incredibly inspiring.
<br><br>
I think we should practice this style of life-even to the smallest extent. For example: when going out and buying new clothes before we purchase the item we should ask ourselves whether we already have something that does the same function? Is the new item so much better than the other that I would be willing to donate the older articles. Plus by doing this act we become more charitable and empathetic to the  predicaments other people are going through.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, I was very surprised. Indeed, it is not my first time to heard about minimalism, but it could the most shock one. Before I watch this video, I tend to link minimalism with poor or lower social/economy status. However, it is not true at all. It is a way of life and it can also be understood as a philosophy. It is a way of thinking that we do not need things that we do not need in our life. One of the most famous minimalism is Stev Jobs who believe that Less is More. Just like Apple and iphone 4, he get rid of all the keyboards and bring a huge screen to us which change the whole generation of phone industry. After I watch this video, I am totally agree with the idea that ADs are forcing us to buy things. Due to the industrialisation, the price of making it become cheap, so people make more and sell more. We have higher efficiency now, but we do not have more materials. The earth's resources are limited. Also, when people hear that being a minimalism means you need to get rid of most of your belongings, people get scary. However, this does not mean you are decrease your quality of life, you are just get rid of things you do not use or you do not need. This will actually allow you to be more focused on the important things. Just like Stev Jobs, he do not think or worry things that are not important so allow him to focus more on the important things. It is worth try for us to try being a minimalism for a short time to realized the true feelings.

Minimalism was my favorite film of all, I thought it was the it was the most interesting film of them all. Seeing people live in such small spaces and with very little things has got me thinking, “Do I really need everything that have right and what value does it bring to me.”  This film really got me interested to see what it would be like to live without a lot of the things I own and to cut down on stuff. One thing about this film that got me thinking about trying to be a minimalist was when the family of 4 was living a minimalist lifestyle. Frankly I think minimalism could be an option when it comes to trying to be more environmentally friendly. I really enjoyed this film it made think about the important things in life and made me realize material items shouldn’t be a defining factor in life. But honestly ever since I started living in the dorms, I realized I don’t need as much of the stuff that I have right now. If I was at home, I would be buying clothing left and right and half of the time I didn’t need it, but I now understand that I don’t need of all the stuff I have it’s unnecessary and frankly a waste of space.  Honestly, I feel like we could maximize minimalism if famous people did, and I know it sounds sad but it’s the truth, our generation follow people who are rich and they set the trends, so if one of them started talking about living a minimalist life then the word would spread and more people would want to do it.

I definitely agree with you! I feel like living in the dorms made me realize that the bulk of the stuff I left at home and some of the stuff I brought to my dorms are not very necessary for me in my daily life. At first, I thought I would need everything I brought to my dorm and I was sad to leave some things behind, but now I know that I barely need the extra clothes and shoes, and it became more of a hassle and clutter in my dorm. The idea of minimalism sounds very daunting and feels like you need to get rid of everything important, but rather it makes you reconsider what IS important. Living with less clutter and only buying what is necessary allows for less stress in life and let's you focus on what is more important in your life. On top of this, it is an environmentally friendly way of life that I think most college students can easily adapt to, since most of us are already living in smaller spaces (dorms, apartments, etc). Especially, in Santa Barbara, most of us bike or take public transport anyways, so this minimalistic lifestyle would not be a drastic change for us.

I really enjoyed watching the documentary "Minimalism" I have heard of the word before a couple of years ago and it really interested me. Every time I go to buy something I always ask myself "Do I NEED this." I really think that people just don't understand the difference between NEED and WANT. I have brought this idea of Minimalism with family.  I usually get these responses "Sarah, we don't get it all the time" "Its on sale" "But I want it". It is very difficult to get people to not consume, they see 50% off and now its $500, i don't know but to me that's still expensive. People see sales and discounts and think, perfect I need to get it now. My views have always been different from that of my family, but to a degree I can understand. How do you tell someone who grew up in poverty that they don't need something they always wanted. Although, I have not been very effective in stopping my parents from buying things they don't need I have been effective in getting rid of what they don't use or need anymore. Also, just living in apartments in LA, to a degree you have to be minimalist. There's just no space for excess. I consider myself somewhat a minimalist, I do have a bad habit for hoarding clothes, but I have made a move to thrift shop instead of buying new and emptying out what I know I don't wear. I think as I get older and maybe get a place of my own minimalism is the only effective way of living, why have more than what you need. I am hopeful that my generation and younger generations will move more towards minimalism.

After watching the documentary film “Minimalism,” I am sunk in deep thought about my life. As the film goes in the end, “Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns.” To be honest, I do not know how to reject this argument since this is the truth. Nowadays, many people spend most of time chasing for the materials because they believe this is the only right thing to do, and only the materials can provide them feelings of safety. When starting to view myself, I feel magic when I heard that what I do and what I want are all because of what the society tells to do. I thought it is all because of me, because of my desire. However, I cannot deny this argument as well. In fact, the reason I want a better living standard is really because of the society. If the society and the advertisement did not tell me a standard of what succeed people live like, maybe I would not pursue for a better living and maybe I would be much more satisfied by what I already have right now. Even though I still cannot totally agree with everything they do in this film, such as 333 plan and throw away a lot of staff that I do not need, I am now starting to reconsider the things I am doing and trying to figure out the best lifestyle fits me perfect.

I agree wholeheartedly with the idea of minimalism in the film Minimalism . I have never really understood the concept of “buying for the sake of buying” but I have always known that are quite a large amount of people who do indulge in this lifestyle. They live paycheck to paycheck always buying more and more things, thinking that it will give them happiness. While this may give some people happiness and meaning to their life, I do not think this applies to the majority.
<br><br>
I believe the biggest reason that materialism is as big as it is now is because of corporations advertising to children. I find this practice to be disgusting and honestly terrifying. Children are extremely impressionable and if they see advertisement after advertisement about how cool or pretty something is, then they will want that thing too. If the parent then allows the child to have all of their desires, then the child will care less about what they have. They won’t place value into the things they already have so they will want more and more because that is how they think they will be happy. But as the child grows older, they may begin to feel empty even when they do buy the things that they “absolutely needed”. So when the child becomes an adult and begins to have children of their own, they will think back to when they were younger and how “cool” the things they got were. Then the parent will begin to buy all the things that their child wants, and then the cycle is renewed.
<br><br>
While I do not think this will always be the case for how all children are brought or how they may feel about this concept of materialism. I still feel I have to address the idea that this is a reality that some people live and I hope that it ends soon.

After watching the documentary it reminded me of the video that Ken talked about last week. In "Can one generation do what previous have failed to do?" Ken mentions 5 ways that we can all do to reduce our carbon footprint by fifty percent. Living a Minimalist lifestyle so what follow these guides by reducing the space that they live in and reuse the things that they have. Joshua and Ryan sought a life that only requires the important things of life, the minimalist of belongings needed to live a comfortable and happy life. Nowadays, we are consuming more than we have ever have in the past. The problem of consumption is when it turns to a regular amount to compulsory consumption which is buying things just because we see others or when we think that we need it. When the next iPhone or the newest product comes out we are driven by others to buy it when the one that we have is still in good condition. However, we fall into the temptation of compulsory consumption when we see other people buy it because we want to fit in. The world has a limited amount of resources and by buying with this mentality it will one day kill off all the resources that the Earth has to offer. The gist of the 5 ways to reduce our carbon footprint is to live our lives with the things that we need and not with the things we want. They are two very different things but nowadays we can't distinguish the difference. Living a minimalistic lifestyle will cut our carbon footprint but that life does not appeal to everyone. People have lived to buy things that they want and have raised the next generation to live a life just as they have. All in all, the film Minimalism: A Documentary about the important things" gives a new approach about how to live a better and more sustainable future with just living life with the things that you need.

Minimalism is living life as simple as possible and fully utilizing materials. In the first video “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy”, it elaborates on the history behind America’s environmental crisis and financial job instability. The 1970’s was the beginning of the increase in food prices, peak oil, and climate devastation and 2008 was a time where 8 million jobs, 3 Trillion U.S. dollars got lost. The video offers some solutions such as Eco-intelligence with D.I.Y gardening to live more Eco-friendly. Wealth is further elaborated in “High Price of Materialism” where it is often mistakenly stereotyped that it will automatically bring you love and other happiness. Money cannot buy sincere emotions. I thought these two videos were nice in terms that it further dived into the topic of materialism by giving data and facts. I agree that commercialism & consumerism leads to image control and the distraction of caring less for the earth.  To summarize, Ken puts this all together to tell us that it is “not enough to just consume, we have to make the right decisions”. A plenitude economy would not only minimize workload but also create a sustainable way of living. I think it is a possible way of lifestyle for some, but I just do not know if that will really become a reality for everyone. People all around the world live in such materialistic society that it will be hard to give up privileges.

The documentary clearly shows that how people dominated by their own desire of buying things, and quite astonishing to me that I never think that people consume things more than they need is bad. After watching this video, I start to think that whether it is necessary that we buy things more than we need. I believe it is the will to dominate that make people to consume more than they need. The minimalism sounds like to make some sacrifice which means that people must give up their desire at some point. However, I think this lifestyle, which is just consume as much as people need and make none waste at all, it necessary and should be advocate by people.

The film Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things is a very compelling documentary about consumerism and human behaviour. The documentary tackles issues of neurobiology/psychology which are very important in explaining over-consumerism and consumer depression. I liked the allusion to human evolution; the film conveys a sharp understanding of a misunderstood issue. It is fascinating to think that a human behaviour that was extremely useful when we were but Neanderthals turns out to be awful today. Technology has evolved much faster than we have, which I think is a key phenomenon in many cases. 
<br><br>
If over-consumerism comes from “addictions” or “illusions”, then that is a rather good news. Addictions can be broken by humans, it is merely a question of time and fresh life perspectives. Furthermore, watching this film may make some shudder at our own modern behaviours. Compelling.

I thought your comment was awesome and I especially liked the point you mentioned about marginal utility you are so right. That literally proves through economics that we will be less happy the more stuff we buy that we don’t actually need because we get less and less utility from each purpose. I really do think, as Minimalism the documentary pointed out that consuming more stuff does not make us any happier no matter what the advertisers say, it has actually made us more depressed and less happy and more lonely. The documentary mentioned some key points that I think everyone should know as you said. One, they mentioned a potential explanation to why we participate in consumer culture. Basically evolutionarily we have a biologically based delusional craving to want things we do not have. One of the narrators of the documentary said this “autocraving” was a great way to keep early animals and humans surviving, thus humans today even are still wired the same way: to become dissatisfied. THis is so good for business: they keep coming out with newer and newer models of things to play on your inherent dissatisfaction and pose their product as the solution, then that product will get outdated and the process repeats, basically never ending profit but also never being fulfilled for the consumer. To be happy, and to help the environment, you can’t play into the consumer chase of more things that make you happy. 
<br><br>
 The documentary mentioned such a good point from Jim Carey which is this “I wish everyone could become rich and famous so they can realize its not the answer”. I loved that this quote was mentioned. Naysayers say “easy to say when you are rich and famous’. Yeah really? He has everything the American ‘dream’ says is a perfect life and he still is saying its not the answer. He’s the actual person who can tell us the truth about the ideal American dream because he is living it yet he doesn’t feel it is a dream at all hence ‘not the answer’. I really think our society has a flawed misconception, majorly flawed of what actually brings fulfillment in our lives. What’s funny is that now we have more choices than ever and more options to consume but there is paradox of choice: the more options we have, the more we are indecisive and the more we think about better alternatives after making a choice. This relates to social psychology’s term of cognitive dissonance. When you make one choice when there were other options, your brain reduces the dissonance by thinking of the good things of your choice and the bad of the alternative. But what if you have 100 other options? 1000? In today’s mass consumer culture that’s a reality. Therefore we are getting increasingly worse at believing we made a good choice (reducing dissonance) and it is making us more uncomfortable, disatifided, and miserable. 
<br><br>
Minimalism also said that mediation is a technique of finding well being in the present moment without needing some special stimulus. I found this point particularly appealing as I meditate for 40 min a day. It really hit home how meditation can better my life. 
 <br><br>
 Lastly, it said that the average person checks their phone 150x a day! This is just a representation of the over stimulated, stressful lives we live. I firmly believe compulsive phone checking is an escape, an escape from confronting our deeper issues, from thinking and questioning our lives, and preventing us from being fully free. Notifications from snap, insta, message, whatever, sets off a dopamine hit in our brain and keeps us addicted and coming back. We then become dependent on these things to get our dopamine hit rather than creating it from things that we actually crave: real connection not technological superficial connection, real approval and acceptance not likes on instagram, and real standards of comparison to others not glorified only the best of the best portrayal of people’s lives on social media.

I loved your comment! I found this film to be very eye-opening and it left me with great respect for both Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Milburn. As I was listening to all these different people speak on how minimalism has improved their overall quality of life, I couldn’t help but think of all the things that I possess, but don’t really need.

I would like to think that I am the type of person that thinks more than twice when purchasing something that I want but don’t need. However, after watching this documentary I’m realizing that I am very guilty of owning many things that I could live without and have bought out of impulse. 
<br><br>
It is no secret that the mindset of the American people revolves around ideas of ‘bigger’ being better and feelings of instant gratification. Many of us are looking to find fulfillment in the wrong things. Living materialistically only brings temporary happiness.This is the point you mentioned. I feel inspired by what you wrote to be less compulsive and more aware and intentional in my decisions.
<br><br><hr><br>

 Wonderful stuff you said and I couldn't agree more. This documentary was eye opening and amazing. I agree we are in a very strange world where life is equal to "the goods life". It encourages us to own more stuff in order to become happier. However, once we fall into this lie, we are left with bad emotions--anxiety, depression, and angry. When I was in middle school, I used to observe the shoes of my classmates. If I saw their cool shoes, I would beg my parents to buy me the same one. But this kind of idea is hard to be satisfied. I was not happy when I wore shiny shoes. This was because I was thinking about the new one. Sometimes companies employ such thought of customers to make more money. They create advertisements targeted at different age groups. In order not to be deceived by these tricks, we need to promote intrinsic value as mentioned by the video. Volunteering is one effective example. When your heart is filled by these positive energies, it will leave space to install wrong social values. In this way, we can feel the real happiness. Little kids crying not getting a new toy are a prime example of how consumer culture is winning. It's time to fight back.

What makes minimalism difficult to achieve are the illusions that our society holds on to. We feed into consumerism, materialism, and status. There is this illusion that our life should be perfect, and happiness brought to us by what we own. Sadly, in our society, measure of success is determined by material things. I believe that it is possible to get enough people to participate in maximizing minimalism. As seen in the film, many already have shown interest. I think the most important mention was that even those with families are able to adapt to this lifestyle. I think everyone can be a minimalist and the practice could be beneficial to our society. I agree that we do live in a “junk culture” where we can’t escape advertisement and the collection of unnecessary materials. I did find the housing for some of the minimalist quite extreme, but everyone has their own way of adapting to minimalism. Even if we just declutter our space and not buy into materialistic objects that we definitely do not need, we are taking a big step forward. I believe as more people practice minimalism, the idea will begin to spread and for those who have a positive outcome will begin to share their story. The documentary itself was very positive and optimistic. They showed that it was doable, and that change begins with spreading the message to others.

The film "Minimalism" is honestly one of the best documentaries I've gotten to watch. I've head the term minimalism before and had a vague idea of what it entailed, but this film took it all one step deeper. One this I found really interesting and motivating was the part in the movie where we saw how people would sell most or all of their belongings and move into these tiny homes where everything was condensed and compact. It's crazy to see some people going to these measures in order to reduce their footprint on the earth, and yet there is a whole other group that refuses to make even the smallest changes to help the cause. Another thing I was really into was Project 33. I am definitely the type of person that has a whole closet full of clothes that definitely aren't being worn all the time, and yet I still go shopping and get more. That being said it was cool to see how women were condensing their closest to only 33 pieces and creating outfits out of those. When Jay Austin, a designer of those tiny houses, talked about how we as consumers buy things , like large homes, that 99 percent off the time aren't being put to use to their full extent, and that consumerism is driven by the need to fit in with the stats quo. Juliet Schor even said that consumerism and fashion is driven by our want to fit in. This part of the film also began talking about fast fashion and she said this line "We're in a world in which material goods are so important for their symbolic meaning, what they do to position us in the status system based off advertisements". After she said that I really thought about all the clothes sitting in my closet and how a lot of them I got because they were what was in trend in the moment, and now are gathering dust. It honestly upsets me too because when you think about how these clothes are being made in sweat shops or by child laborers, why would you support them? Watching this film definitely had me sit back and reflect on my patterns of living and what steps I can do to change them. I don't know that I will be selling all my belongings and moving into a tiny house with only 33 pieces of clothes, but any small change I can make, like shopping from thrift stores more, would beneficial.

The movie Minimalism is fantastic and impressive to me. After watching this movie, I believe that minimalism is a viable and meaningful option to people. To begin with, being a minimalist does not mean that a person buys nothing and does not spend any money during his life. I think it means that a person spends money on those necessities which are highly valuable to his life. For example, if we will move into a new house, we need to buy numerous things including furnitures, beds, and so on. As a minimalist, the person might only buy those things that he needs them for most of time in his life. The decorations and some entertainment equipments might consider as invaluable things for minimalists. In our society now, a lot of people spend huge amount of money on clothes, shoes, and make up. Some people change their clothes every day, and this habit and cost are considered as unnecessary for minimalists. In conclusion, minimalist believe that people only should spend money on those products that helps and values to you in your life. I strongly believe that this idea will bring dramatic change to our society as it can profoundly reduces waste in our life. People might waste too much money but they do not realize. Therefore, I think that this lifestyle proposed by minimalists have a lot of benefits and can change some bad habits if we follow this lifestyle. It is an inspiring movie to all of us.

Damn, I have way too much stuff in my life. After watching the film, “Minimalism, A Documentary on the Important Things” I think most people will think they own way too many materialistic things in life. It’s a good time to self-reflect and think about what one owns and compare what is excess and what is a necessity. Professor Hiltners video, explaining minimalism touches upon consumerism. This is a big part why people overextend and buy so much. Along with advertising, consumerism makes up a big part of our society and explains why everyone has so much stuff. This film brings to light what one can do to partake in cutting back on the excess. As professor explains in his video, this is a good solution that first-world countries can act on since first-world countries contribute so much to the global climate change.

After watching Minimalism, I realized there are things I do need to work on within myself and my lifestyle. There are materialistic items I claim I need, but in the reality of it, that “need” is practically only a “want.” I was blessed with parents with high paying occupations, a big house, and comfortable living. Growing up, I would consider that a blessing, and I am grateful for that, but I went through the majority of my childhood and teen years visualizing a future with a very successful job with the biggest house imaginable. However, four weeks into this course, I feel like my perspective on living has really changed. Being “blessed” does not amount to having the most expensive items out of your friend group, nor does it mean you have a bigger house than your co-worker, but in today’s world, it does. 
<br><br>
I had a really strong correlation to a new song by rapper, Lil’ Wayne when I watched this documentary. Wayne’s song, “Dream,” elaborates on his fear of losing all the wealth he accumulated, and how he would not be able to live the “American Dream” due to lack of materialistic items if such circumstances occurred. This American rapper is looked up to by many individuals around the globe, and is very well-known. Him feeling this way about achieving his dreams puts emphasis on what defines happiness and success, further relating to what makes an individual “better” than another. Most celebrities put their wealth towards luxurious lifestyles and comfortable living, which puts the idea in others’ minds that such wealth must be attained to keep up with this fast-paced world of consumerism. 
<br><br>
As stated in the documentary, Americans seem to have “blinders” on when it comes to visualizing what our lives should and should not look like. As trends come and go, humans want more. More this, more that, new this, new that. I can own up to that being the mindset I once had and somewhat still do. The idea of the “perfect life” goes even further than just wealth. Social media plays a large role as well due to people wanting to portray the best version of themselves to the public, whether it be true or not...and even if what is on social media is true, why must we put filters over our images/videos, and why must we be so particular with what we post? It is a never-ending cycle of wanting to be accepted by both those we know and no not know. 
<br><br>
When I saw the ex-corporate employees (now minimalists) speaking to a very small crowd of people, it discouraged me because not many people care about minimalist culture, nor do they want to gain more information about it. I get how minimalism strays from what the majority of the world deems as successful. As one of the minimalists states, “that is just one template, not the template” [for living]. It made me happy to see how minimalism had become a sort of trend in modern day culture. This was made evident when The Minimalists were asked to be on the Today Show. Minimalist culture was broadcasted to millions of people, but I am not sure if that is because of the actual genuine want to create a happier/healthier lifestyle, or because this type of living is on the verge of becoming very popular amongst the youth and elderly.

The film "Minimalism" has introduced a concept that I have never thought of before. It is a great film with great goal, to convince people give up materialism, which is pursue by most of human beings intentionally or non-intentionally and as the lecture that we have watched last week said, this behavior of materialism in fact is one of the five major issues that is hurting our Earth. Minimalism is a great idea that certainly will not be easy to implement at first. For example in the film, the ladies were asked only to bring 33 things with them for a hour month, including clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Of course it sound horrible only to 33 things to live for a whole month at first especially for us girls. However, this is a meaningful thing and after thinking carefully, I figured that 33 things is just enough for us to endure one month, and if we are used to it, it will not be too hard. If we organized clearly, 33 absolutely can include all necessities we need for one month.
<br><br>
In my opinion, Minimalism definitely worth a try and I believe that eventually it will work for most of the people who give it a shot. Psychologically saying, it is also a great opportunity to educate people that the simplest is the happiest.
</p><hr>

<p>
While I have always been interested in the low-impact, minimalistic lifestyle, the film "Minimalism" really struck me.  I feel like it kind of whipped me into shape, showing me personal anecdotes that I could relate to.  We have created a society that places our worth based on how much we work and how much we have. Ryan and Joshua, as well as many of the other individuals in the film, spoke from personal experience that they were unhappy in those situations. I was also inspired by the 333 challenge, only wearing 33 items for 3 months.  To be fair, I am a college student with limited space so I don't think I own much more than 33 items, but I felt it was an easy way to get those who have excess clothes to cut back.  I was also glad the film brought up the dangers of fast fashion. That is primarily why I try to buy from small, sustainable shops or second hand.  It is extremely important for people to understand the effects their consumerism has on the environment.

I think minimalism is a viable and meaningful option. Moving into on-campus dorms last fall after living in a somewhat large house my life was an experience I was not looking forward to. Sharing a small room with two other students did not seem appealing and seemed almost ridiculous to be paying so much money for. However, I found myself enjoying this space that we share. In my house back at home, I did find myself overwhelmed by the space that I lived in and the amount of things I had lying around. Whenever I felt like this, I found comfort and relief in the feeling I got after clearing out my old wardrobe and donating old clothes. This is a feeling I know a lot of my friends can relate to. But the unpleasant feeling of clutter and having an overwhelming amount of ‘things’ can be avoided from the beginning if we changed our mindsets about and ways of consuming.
<br><br>


This film did a successful job making a connection between lifestyle changes that help us find purpose in our lives and bettering the environment while doing so. We can shape the overall quality of our lives and minimalism is only one way of doing so. I also appreciated how they emphasized that minimalism means something different to everyone. We each carry our own values and we decide what is important to us. It would be better for us and the planet to live a life that is more centered around what is essential to our lives.

The film "minimalism" introduces an idea of minimalism which states what is the value of a thing if they need it. In other words, if the thing cannot bring in any value that the minimalists will choose to give that thing up instead. And they live their lives in the simplest ways; according to them that the minimal lifestyle brings them happiness. But I realized that the reasons for becoming a minimalist in the video are not for environmental purposes. As Ken said, are for their own happiness and freedom. In some aspects, it does help the environment. 

<br><br>
What is on the contrary side of the minimalism is the consumerism. Consumerism has deeply affected people in the world. With the trade between countries that the goods become cheaper and more affordable; with the development of the technology that the goods become easily accessible for people. Behind consumerism is the deteriorating of the environment. Because consumerism is a catalyst for the economy and the increasing for the economy cannot survive without consuming the environment; fossil fuels, use of trees, and toxic industrial emission are the invisible side effects of consumerism that people do not easily realize. 
<br><br>

I think that minimalism is a little bit extreme, and it does not originally come upon on an environmental basis. There are hundreds of ways to achieve happiness, which means for hundreds of people there are hundreds of interpretations of happiness. What do agree on is that people need to find a balance between choices or things. And people can approach the climate crisis from other prospects. However, it is true that consumerism has gone too far on generations of generations.

After watching "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I make sense of that this video truly reflected how human continually need to purchase things or expend the things they like. Furthermore, I start to see how genuine it is that individuals have squandered or expended the diminishes that they don't generally require. moderation way of life implies we ought to devour less and less. From my own point of view, as someone that lives in a van I understand how freeing and satisfying it is to only have a small selection of belongings. Living in such a way really brings to light what is necessary.
</p><hr>

<p>
I do believe minimalism is a meaningful and viable way of living our modern lives as the minimalist lifestyle drastically decrease the environmental impacts we have on the planet by directly purchasing less and using less. Imagine how many more people could find a home in the city if everybody becomes a minimalists and land-usage would become significantly efficient. Consumption wise, if more people live like this, the decrease in the demand of goods will deter cooperation to produce so much and lessen the damage to the planet. However, it would be very difficult to actually convince the general public to adapt and become minimalists due to the fact that modern consumerism has become the foundation of our lifestyles. I think education would be crucial and the film did a very good job on informing the audience on the behavior and psychology behind our purchases. As Rick Hanson said in the film, “I think it goes to the bottom line fact that you can never get enough of what you don’t really want. Deep down we want what objects will bring us.” Once we understand that the urge to purchase is associated with the attachment to the symbols that are given to the objects by society, it would be a lot easier to control our actions.

Watching Minimalism, I liked how the movie followed the story of the two guys who call themselves the “Minimalists” while also exploring the lives of other minimalists like Colin Wright, who states how “I only have 51 things in the entire world.” Packing his stuff in as little as two duffels, I couldn’t imagine myself doing that. Just packing for winter break required a mini suitcase and two duffels, and that wasn’t even the half of my stuff. Coming back from winter break, I realized how much I overpacked. I talked to my friends and they experienced the same thing too, sharing the experience of mostly wearing the same sweater all break. Though three weeks of a break is nothing compared to the manner Wright carries his belongings in a bag for life, it feels like a smaller scale version of that. I’ve been in several Airbnb’s before and the small houses that they talk about in the movie feel like the tiny places you can rent. I’ve always found it cool how the people who own Airbnb’s have been able to accommodate life into a single space. There was one time I was in a tiny trailer, less than half the size of a dorm room at UCSB, but it had a bed, sink, shower, toilet, and everything. For Minimalists, it’s a dream. For me, it was ideal for one night but again, I still look forward to having a place of my own that’s bigger than a single room with everything. Of course, the film did make me rethink a lot of what I aspire to have. One of my favorite aspects of the movie was how realistic it was, like the segment with the married couple and how she comments how the way her husband owns a very little amount of clothing is fine with her. It’s like saying people should practice minimalism to some degree. Like one of the authors said, you don’t have to give away your sentimental collection.

I think this film did a great job of communicating its subject to its audience. I completely agree with their message that owning "stuff" simply does not make you happy. People for some reason still believe that owning lots of cars, clothes, homes, or other things will bring you that piece of happiness you are missing. Also, commercials and advertisements are the reason that people believe they need to continue to get the latest and greatest things despite the old product being perfectly fine and capable. Consumerism has plagued the west and caused so many people to become completely miserable. People should be like Ryan and begin to question why they actually need these things. This film does have environmentally ties in the sense that consumerism causes people to waste products and cause pollution creating massive pollution in the atmosphere and on the earth's lands. Consumerism has been rooted in the United States since the beginning portraying being successful as owning a lot of things and having a high salary. Each item created has a carbon footprint and the more we consume the more carbon is released into the atmosphere spiking climate change. Personally, I am very minimalist. I try to only get the absolute necessities and keep the same clothes or phones until not usable anymore. It made me very happy to see that over one hundred and fifty people showed up to the minimalists talk and people are actually taking steps towards changing their habits. If all people began to act this way we could end the constant cycle of consumerism and advertisements. The advertisements direct messages towards kids for them to continue to buy their toys which are nothing more than junk. The final message that was delivered in the film was very moving. We should live by our values and not based on consuming products. true happiness can only be found in the connections we share with other people, not by owning useless things. I would recommend this film to many people, especially people I know. Many are so obsessed with getting the newest iPhone or MacBook when they should be focused on the people around them and living in the moment.

The documentary Minimalism presents how several people from very different backgrounds found happiness through a minimalist lifestyle. The social issues like people being too material, car addiction, excessive clothing consumption and toy consumption that the documentary brought up got me thinking. Advertisements nowadays give people an illusion that life should be great and we need these things to make our lives better. In my opinion, it is not wrong to chase better things, but they should be bought based on needs otherwise would become wastes. Thus, we need to consider whether we really need it or not before we purchase something, and it would also bring a positive effect on the environment. Imagine that people only buy 4 season clothes instead of buying more than 50 seasons clothes as mentioned in the film; there would be less production, which means less pollution. Imagine that every family only buys one car and not buying more for superiority; there would be less harmful emission.
<br><br>
Besides that, speakers in the documentary frequently mentioned that “money can’t buy happiness” and one of them even gave up her 90% property to live in a tiny house. Some people might be confused, but I think that happiness is a choice, not a result, and nothing will make you happy unless you decide to be happy. Clearly, these minimalists found their own way to reach happiness. Overall, the film was very well made and inspired a great deal of thinking.

“Visualizing a Plenitude Economy”, like its title, introduce viewers to a new way of living: reduce work time and increase personal break-time. Less work means more time to relax, people have more time to spend on their hobbies and deepen connections with their families and friends. I learned that while this kind of lifestyle increasing people’s personal well being, it also reduces consumption and degradation of natural resources. An example would be people choose to take walks or go to the park instead of shopping at malls. This shift in people’s life allows us to live more sustainable. 
<br><br>
The short film, “The High Price of Materialism” first point out that many of us have the wrong idea when we think about having a happy and successful life. Bombed by the commercials we see in our daily life, we’ve been brainwashed by companies that buying stuff will make your day better, but the truth is, owning more stuff actually make you less happy, even worse, more stressed. Speaking personally, I often feel miserable looking at the clothes I bought. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I couldn’t find one thing to wear. Secondly, like what stated in the previous film “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy,” huge consumption cause the degradation of natural resources and damage to the environment. This film also provide possible ways we could do to reduce consumption, such as using ad-block when watching TV or surfing on the internet, building intrinsic value, and advocate policies that promote intrinsic values.

The film “Minimalism” is effective at communicating the subject of the importance of minimalism and its meaning to our life. It shows the trips of two minimalists Josh and Ryan promoting their book and sharing their stories about the importance of minimalists and life status after becoming minimalists. 
<br><br>
This is a really good documentary.  It can teach you how to control yourself to avoid shopping too much. Over shopping will not only will you waste lots of money, but it also pollutes the environment when you buy a lot of useless things and throw them. I really enjoy watching this documentary. It is very meaningful. My response to it was primarily intellectual. I learned a lot from the documentary. It really makes my eyes open. I know the world “Minimalism” very early. Before I watched the documentary, I thought the world just uses to describe an object that is in a very simple color or buy very little things. Then, I understand the world  “Minimalism” not just means buy very little things. It also describes a person’s life attitude. It’s really helpful for our life to watch this documentary. Because there are tons of discount activities every year, people need to behave themselves and not buy too many useless things.

I completely second everything you said. It was really interesting watching Josh and Ryan's journey across the United States and how they seemed just so... happy. Everything they had and did serve a purpose and while they were against compulsory consumption, they never showed any sign of anger or disgust at their old lives or the lives that really surround them. I thought that this documentary could genuinely affect Ken's idea of climate control through personal actions because if you minimize everything you buy and use then it makes sense that you wouldn't add to the idea of fast fashion, a damager of the climate because you already have everything that you realistically "need".
<br><br>
Similar to what Mingyang felt, I also thought of minimalism in a different sense. Originally I knew it as a term for art pieces and such but after watching this documentary, I felt like I was exposed to a more truthful sense of the idea of what minimalism really is. It really is an interesting idea especially when you think of the terms and instances in which these people turned to minimalism. These are pretty wealthy and well-set people removing objects from their lives that they really don't need to do. Nobody would look upon them with discontent or maliciousness for having extra items when they are as well off as they are. Overall, I felt that this was a pretty good documentary not only for being able to show what they are about but for exposing the idea of minimalism all the while being relatively persuasive without seeing uncomfortable in their tactics.

This documentary does a great job setting itself apart from the rest of the films because it gives a viable option that the rest fail to acknowledge. I really enjoyed watching this film because it emphasizes that one does not need materialistic items to be happy, all while highlighting that cutting down the items you own can actually help the environment. Admittedly, I would consider myself as a materialistic person because I invest in items that I don’t absolutely need and don’t necessarily have an emotional attachment to, such as shoes, clothing and watches. Watching this film not only makes me realize that by purchasing such products I am not contributing to the efforts to conserve our environment, but it also helped me acknowledge the fact that one does not need items outside our basic needs to make us happy. The feeling of satisfaction when purchasing material is only short-lived; the contribution to climate change and the negative impacts it will continue to have on our planet are here to stay for many more years to come. The film is actually effective at communicating that committing to a minimalist life is not so difficult after all. The producers do this by demonstrating how even a family of four can commit to such a lifestyle. The film has made me very curious as to just how happy the minimalist life is and it has for sure intrigued me to try it myself. I thought the film was overall captivating and unique compared to previous films, thus it is why I would give it a four star rating out of five. I would definitely recommend it to a friend, especially to one that owns too many products without any sentimental value.

I watched the two short films as an alternative to having already read "Minimalism" and having strong opinions about how lessening consumerism would be a huge benefit and by all means something that should at least be encouraged to be perused, at least with the intent of being genuinely environmentally friendly and not just more expensive spending in smaller amounts. Though, that's not what my main point of focus for this comment. In fact, while I am entirely a supporter of fighting against consumerism, one of the short films we were asked to watch, Visualizing a Plenitude Economy," left me rather skeptical.

<br><br>
I'm a supporter of the incentive behind the video's message; less consumerism leads to more community bonds leads to more environmentally friendly action. All things I've heard before and for the most part believe. However, I felt some of the presentation of solving these issues lead me with more questions. Juliet Schor mentions that full-time working should be lessened to only an 80% day spread out between more workers. Okay, that seems like just a generally more beneficial move, even if not for environment point of view, workload is just generally way too much for the human person to manage, from stresses to conditions. I could see the environmental support for this move because having more time would encourage better relationships between community and perhaps by some lengths get some people to work on projects that are better for local communities. Schor makes a leap at one point, however, that less work leads to less consumerism. How? If people have more free time on their hands, some people will lead to building community, but that's only some. Being a kid that had school breaks, for example, I know for a fact made people buy more things and go more places, leading to heftier carbon footprints. People with more time are more likely to splurge, at least, that's how I would imagine it. Schor does say the opposite, but I don't know, I'm a bit skeptical of the connections made there.

<br><br>
The second film, "The High Price of Materialism," was effective in communicating it's message. I had no issues with the presentation, only thing was it just things I've already heard of without adding anything unique. So, in short, great message and one I'm entirely supportive of, that consumerism is a trap that leads to more harm than the momentary pleasure it can bring about. We're drowning in advertisements and disconnected from the world around us, that it's truly an epidemic. We've come to not even bat an eyelash at the constant onslaught of advertisements and every month the purchasing of goods that we probably secretly know we don't need. Something needs to change, even if it does mean covering them up, as the video suggested.

Before the film, I did not know about the whole thing about a percentage of a house being unused.  After the film, I now know that on average 40% of a house is unused by the members inside.  I would say this is definitely true because at almost every house I go to I can tell the area where many of the members do not use.  In my house, we have two living rooms but we do not use one of the living rooms and just have furniture there.  I thought the connection to climate change and living space was unique.  I did not even think that living space inside a house affects the climate.  I always find these little houses with moving and changing furniture inside to be cool but most houses are not averagely made like that and if one wanted their house to be like that they had to make it themselves.  

<br><br>
After the introduction by Ken, I thought the idea of reducing the labor within one's life was interesting.  If one has to buy fewer clothes then they would not have to work as much because they are not spending as much.  I thought the connection with time and labor was great.  Sweden as mentioned by Ken they have fewer work hours in their week and to replace that time they do things like planting their own food etc.. I thought that is so efficient and other countries should do the same.

I have been enthralled with the idea of minimalism for a long time.  Growing up, my mom pseudo-practiced minimalism; although she was not completely minimalistic, she emphasized practicing gratitude for the natural earth and not having many things that were completely unnecessary.  She did this somewhat for the element of minimizing our carbon footprint but her main focus was always the theory that having more does not create happiness.  Because of this, I’ve always been someone who does not buy into the consumer culture and sees it as an inherent money-making distraction from the true meaning of life.  This being said, I absolutely loved the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things”; it served as a reminder to get back to the things that are actually important in life and not to focus so much on the minutiae and chaotic scramble of modern society.  I firmly believe that a minimalistic lifestyle leads to a greater degree of happiness and overall peace and I try to practice this to the best of my ability.
<br><br>
As for the impact on the climate crisis, living a minimalist lifestyle makes perfect sense to me.  Because consumerism is so ingrained in modern society, I think it would be incredibly challenging to get massive amounts of people to transition to minimalism.  I think that the best way to do this would be attraction rather than promotion; however, the amount of time this would take would probably be a lot longer than we have to solve the climate crisis.  While I think minimalism is an incredibly valuable investment, it seems like a lifestyle most people are not willing to commit to, even though it could tremendously mitigate fossil fuel emissions.  Most people do not view the climate crisis as being as severe as it is which does not encourage rapid change.  Overall, I think that minimalism is a beautiful lifestyle and incredibly important in regards to the climate crisis.

The film "Minimalism" has shown us how minimalism changes every aspect of our life. By providing a different solution to the climate issue that we are facing right now, the film effectively conveys the idea of minimalism. Minimalism is a lifestyle that isn't merely living with nothing but utilizes all the resources around you in the most efficient way. Minimalism is a reliable way to protect our environment because it prevents unnecessary waste of resources and developing a healthy lifestyle among people. On the dark side, minimalism might hurt our economy because many people stop buying things to fulfill the goal of minimalism. In nowadays society, consumerism has become a driving force to boost our economy. Minimalism, in this case, can be seen as a challenge to consumerism because minimalism encourages people to reduce consumption. That's why Minimalism is hard to accomplish because it will potentially hurt our economy, and most people like buying things. Nevertheless, from an environmental perspective, minimalism is still a feasible way to solve climate issues.

As I was watching "Minimalism," I couldn't help but wonder why anyone would want to work hard if they will either 1) not be well compensated or 2) be well compensated but not be able to spend that money. While I do believe that money should never be the primary reason one chooses a certain career, I do believe that people who work hard should be rewarded financially and have the right to spend that money how they please. One could make the argument that people could be more conscientious about how they spend their money and make environmentally sound decisions. However, I feel like expecting everyone to live an extremely minimalist lifestyle would have many people thinking why they should even work hard in the first place.
</p><hr>

<p>
Having now watched all 3 films, I feel as thought the first film on minimalism is taking a very different approach to eco-friendly living as the second two films, which are arguing for what I would call both sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyles. Honestly, I disagree with minimalism on the basis of how it seems to be a class-related fantasy of the rich. Minimalism, though the actions and  means it takes to live simply accessible are within reach for all, subtly implies a specific visual aesthetic that involves living spaces and items that are not within reach of everyone. It is not enough to live simply and be minimalistic, you must also live within the aesthetic in order to be considered a true minimalist under most metrics. Since this involves financial choices that cannot be universally taken, Minimalism inherently begs the question, “do I know the right things in the right amount” and requires a level of consumption within its own confines, I therefore disagree with it as a practice.
<br><br>
 Alternatively, the two videos reach for something more robust and universally accessible: choices we can all make to revert the way in which a gross economy of consumerism can take hold of our lives and make us live in a single-use, “luxurious” life. Living without materials or living without close regard to materials is something that makes us happy without consideration for a specific aesthetic. It is something that makes us feel more connected to each other, more secure with who we are as naked individuals, and more alive without the influence of capitalism. By even bringing production back into the home and out of the factory, and by creating networks of trade and recycling, we are building relationships of support that are stronger than a factory, and make us stronger as people.

My favorite part of "The Minimalist" was the accountant interview in the corner office about to get "minted" and handed everything society told him was success in life and materialistic accomplishments. To be able to step away from it all, I'm amazed. I consider myself an ambitious, hard working person, and if I was in that scenario, I don’t think I'd be bale to turn it down. But after completing this documentary, I am able to see a different viewpoint and accept other people's sides. While I recognize I am guilty of possessing too many things and realizing I have a high carbon footprint, this class has motivated me to change my behaviors and become less selfish to humanity. While I cannot promise I'll downsize to my 51 most essential things, my eyes have been opened to better ways of living. If people can live in doll houses the size of my college dorm room and be more content that most people, maybe there is power in this movement.

My grandpa is a prime example of money doesn’t buy happiness. After seeking refuge in America through Ellis Island, he worked his way to financial success. Once he achieved his version of the American dream, he realized it didn’t give him happiness. So he moved to India for 7 years on a spiritual quest to find the meaning of life and feel fullfillment, became an apprentice to a Buddha, then held a Q&A at a coffee shop every Sunday for a decade answering peoples questions and doubts to put them on the right path. My grandpa has become my role model, and he was the first one to teach me about global warming. I hope I can do more good than bad in my life as well, by following the golden rule of golf courses: Leave the course (this world) better than you found it. I agree everyone needs to find their own template to govern them. Like your conscience, it should be in accordance with the environment and doctrine of efficiency.

One of the key takeaways I got from the short film "Minimalism" was that as a society we need to learn how to live life "more deliberately with less stuff" as one fo the minimalists, Joshua Millburn stated. Before watching the film, it had never occurred to me that I had so many things both in my apartment at UCSB and back at home that I just didn't need. Even the things that I thought I had 'needed' -- clothes, wall decorations, multiple pairs of shoes, my car -- I realized after watching the film that I could live without them. As a society we are so bought into this culture of materialism and the mindset of "the more the merrier" that we fail to see that these things can actually hurt our relationships and social/personal well-being. We have to sit back and think to ourselves whether or not having all this excess stuff actually brings us any joy or value. 
<br><br>
If we have all this stuff just because the media says we need it, then we become guilty of using other people's lives as a yardstick, as stated in the documentary. This typically always leaves us wanting more and feeling constantly dissatisfied.

I had the same realization as you did last year. Last year I lived in the Santa Rosa Dorms, which meant that I was going to need new decorations. Well at least that is what was going through my head when I was getting started to move in but then I realized that there isn’t a need to buy a bunch of random unnecessary objects to decorate my room even though I was going to move out at the end of the school year. I use to buy new clothes every school year because I felt the need to change things up a bit which created more of a cluster in my wardrobe but I didn’t realize how much clothes I had until I went back home for the summer. I was unpacking when I noticed that everything I had wasn’t going to fit in my wardrobe. I had bought too much clothes in the school year and I know that im not the only one who does this. Since I have so many clothes I only get rid of it if it doesn’t fit, or if it is torn. I don’t throw it away I donate it to reduce my carbon footprint even more. I think that everyone can start by donating what they don’t need.

“Love people and use things”
<br><br>
These words are so simple, but they bury such profound meanings inside of them. And it ironically criticizes how things had been in this 21st century, since we are supposed to be “loving people and using things” in the first place. 
<br><br>
I see this documentary as a journey, a journey two men took on to break away, to free themselves from the restraints of society and seek the true nature inside of their hearts. To break away from the unnecessary materialistic possessions, and run away from the culture telling us what to do, and listen to the voices inside of us, for the first time. We had been “plugged in” to the Matrix, and been feeding the toxic information and desire since we are born. And chances are, as we get older, it’s only going to get worse. These examples can be seen anywhere from 4 year olds to the elders. How funny it is that while I was watching the documentary, I was waiting for my new Converse and Nike shoes to be shipped here from Amazon. Do I really need those shoes? No. Do I already own pairs of shoes that I can run and walk around everyday? Yes. Do they look good on me? Yes. So that’s why I was going to buy them. Not even due to necessity or I was going to walk barefoot without them, but just because they would increase my “swag”, if that’s what I would call it.
<br><br>
I love UCSB as a campus which you can grab a spot on the beach on a sunny afternoon, look into the Santa Cruz island on the opposite shore, and ponder about your life. In the society of today, we gradually lose grip on what we think and want, and we were fading control of who writes the chapter of our lives. As it was mentioned in the documentary, we started blindly following the “templates” constructed by the major companies for their own financial benefits, and we forgot what we want. Recall the last time you had an impetus shopping experience, and how many times you had used the stuff you purchased. We were meant to be the one making the options, but we became more and more “undeliberate”. We were “using people and loving things”. As the movie progresses, I think I started to get to know why Thoreau decided to isolate himself from society. I believe he knew fundamentally what was right, and living in a society full of madness (Corruption of the protestants, etc..) where he was oppressed and had no space to be himself, he couldn’t do more than leaving all behind, and go into the woods and choose to live deliberately.

After watching the movie “Minimalism”, I realized that maybe the big house with 4 suites, 2 living rooms and a ginormous kitchen with 100 acres worth of backyard isn’t necessarily the life I want or need, even if it’s the one I pictured for myself. I pride myself in valuing family, friends and traveling above all, so this life I pictured for myself doesn’t really fit my reality. Having a smaller place, with fewer belongings would allow me, or anyone really, to focus on the things that matter the most for them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the freedom that came with minimalism, in the sense that it is adaptable to any given lifestyle. The point of minimalism is to focus on the things that really matter to you, but not to completely rid yourself of everything you own. As they put it in the movie, if you love books, the smell and feel of them, you don’t have to give them up. But focus on having things that actually matter or are useful to you; think how much you want or need something before you go through with any given purchase.

The human want is unmatched in hunger. Whenever someone reaches their goal, they strive for more and only few are truly happy. I definitely feel that this is not just an American thing but a human thing. We naturally want more but what draws the line between need and greed? Is it the minimalist approach? is it only grabbing what you need with an occasional splurge. I think the key feeling of minimalism is that there is more to life than designer bags and as long as your basic needs are met the you can truly achieve full happiness. This is very specifically stated by Maslow's Hierarchy of Need, when you are able to reach certain steps in the pyramid like basic necessities is when you will be able to reach higher for self actualization. The self actualization achieved in this film was not because of minimalism but the fact that they learned to appreciate certain the keys things that are often overshadowed in our fast paced society. 
<br><br>
Yet I cannot help but think that Minimalism is natural to a large portion of the world. I have a lot of family in Mexico that own ranches and live in only with what they really need. Splurging every once in awhile and though they want more they are still content with what they have. A lot of people do not have the money to consciously practice minimalism because there is no choice. People who are financially stable are able to practice minimalism without stressing because they are already financially sound enough to not worry. Most practices of minimalism are because people do not know how they are going to eat their next meal and despite maybe not in conjunction with the class I felt the need to bring it up. Cutting our consumer ways is an amazing thing. There is no need to waste resources but at the same time I felt that this movie was just propaganda out of minimalism without incorporating intersectionality. There are people of different backgrounds and you can encourage cutting off unnecessary things in different ways.
</p><hr>

<p>
At the beginning of the film, I was extremely skeptical of the idea of minimalism. It seemed like a hippie, unrealistic, and unnecessary ideal. There was no need to throw away all my things. In fact, that was counterintuitive to the fast fashion documentary watched earlier in the quarter. The fast fashion documentary argued we should value and use our items more than we do now. This documentary advocates for the opposite. In order to successfully minimize our carbon footprint, we must make use of everything we own. However, I agree with the film’s notion that we should stop purchasing as many goods, because without these goods, we wouldn’t have this problem. 
<br><br>
In the film, it is entertaining to watch the two author's viewings grow, and it was inspiring to see more and more people care about this issue. Minimization not only helps the human individually but is also a necessary process in the fight against the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
One thing I enjoyed about that idea of minimalism in this film was that it was a realistic solution. The characters in the film all had families and lives outside of living minimally. Most had regular houses and it wasn’t an incredibly drastic difference in their life. However minimalism can create a large impact in one’s quality of life. The need for things is minimized and the need for connection with real people grows. A simple example in the video is when a woman needed a dress for an event, but she didn’t own one. Normally, she would have gone out and bought a dress that she would have never worn again, but she called a friend instead. This increased the connection between friends and decreased the need for more consumption. 
<br><br>
For me personally, this video hit close to home. As a former retail employee, I too have convinced people to buy items that they didn’t need and participated myself in the purchasing of excessive goods. In fact, just this Thanksgiving weekend I spent $300 on items that I arguable didn’t need. I appreciate watching these videos because I now feel encouraged to look at my own life and seek means of improvement within myself for our planet.

Most people don't make the connection between materialistic consumption habits and environmental harm, but the correlation between the two is definitely real. As we buy and buy more stuff to keep ourselves happy, we tend to ignore the impact that it takes on our planet. For instance, heavily supporting capitalistic consumerism allows manufacturers to produce more and more goods, which takes up more resources and puts more carbon into the atmosphere. If people were to rely less of consumerism, then not only would they be more in touch with their intrinsic values, but they'd be helping the planet by a significant margin.
<br><br>
In regards to converting to a "plentitude economy," there are many benefits to this change, but also many flaws. Hiring more workers to reduce the amount of hours per person is a great idea: it allows workers to experience less stress in the workplace, while also mitigating family problems outside of the office. This also creates more jobs, helping poorer individuals secure work in a country where more than half of the wealth is possessed by only a slim percentage of the population. However, since our economy relies on huge corporations that are directly responsible for the unfolding climate crisis, it's hard to imagine a world where we can practically phase out these corporate giants in a timely fashion. Doing this would mean the people (along with various grassroots movements) would have to convince the government not to rely on companies that have been directly supporting them for decades, which seems almost impossible in the timescale we are given to reverse the climate crisis.

I think that the film “Minimalism” does a good job of demonstrating how people can live meaningful lives with less materialistic stuff. I think that minimalism is a viable and meaning option, but as they mentioned in the film it is not a quick and easy process. It takes time to let go of material items and to accept that everything must serve a purpose. I personally live by quality over quantity and think that that idea may help transition people into consuming less material items that have low quality. This idea helps me personally invest in items I truly want and need and that I know I will keep for a long time. I believe that there are degrees to minimalism and that people may be happier with a few more material items, but that there is a threshold to that balance between things and excess happiness, as demonstrated by the couple with children. I think that this film does a good job of sharing multiple stories of other minimalists and not just their own, it added to the films effectiveness and demonstrated that this lifestyle does not have one template. Although I try to only consume what I need, it is difficult to do so in a consumerist society and economy. I think that living a minimalist lifestyle would benefit people's mental health and overall satisfaction in life, allowing them to focus on what is truly important to them. Thoreau's "Walden", our reading for this week, had many parallels to this film and both emphasized how living a more simplistic lifestyle allows people to focus on what brings them true happiness. I think both the film and reading from this week should encourage us to reevaluate what society we want to live in and have us rethink the consumeristic one we live in now. I personally think that by reinventing how we live it will not only help us live more environmentally friendly lives but also help people's mental health. In the short films it stated that as materialistic values go up, pro social values go down. I totally agree with this statement and think that the short films demonstrated viable solutions to living in a plentitude economy and how this would benefit people and the planet.

"Minimalism" is a very eye opening and inspiring film. It really portrays that voluntary minimalism is very possible, rewarding, and promotes well being for ourselves both physically and mentally. Minimalism is not only about saving the climate, but saving money, and allowing us to find freedom from many aspects of our lives. The people interviewed clearly exemplify this in the positive ways they speak about their new lifestyles and mindsets. As Ken says, our lives will not be “drab lives of deprivation,” even though that is what most seem to believe. 
<br><br>
Jay Austin explains that many people view life as follows: they have 500,000 dollars, so they will buy whatever 500,000 can get them, even if they take out loans to accomplish this. The bigger is better philosophy is far from the truth. Joshua Fields Milburn in his moving monologue shows just how ridiculous we sound when he lists off the things we need in our house. Additionally, I was shocked to hear that the fast fashion industry has created 52 seasons per year. Every week the fashion industry wants you to buy new clothes, because the clothes you bought last week are “out of style.” This is so unsustainable.
<br><br>

It is true that “the hunger never gets fulfilled” for new items, but I disagree with the fact that clothes are filling a void for everyone. Personally, I shop at thrift stores and gain true happiness from creating outfits that I like. I do not think I use clothes as a way to fill a void. I think that finding and selling used clothes has become a hobby of mine that brings me true joy. The option of living a life that was “deliberate and intentional” was gone. The problem is not consumption, but it is “compulsory consumption.” Unfortunately, we have built our lives around this kind of consumption. 
<br><br>

Minimalism is a very important and viable. I believe that we must “maximize minimalism,” as Ken says. This film shows that it is possible to do, and beneficial in so many ways. There is no doubt that this would help us individually and help the planet from the wrath of climate change. It is possible to do, however I believe that a large percent of people, especially the older generations, would never consider living simply as an option. Society has gotten them to place too much value on stuff. Reinventing the culture I believe is possible among a large percent of my generation. I believe that we would work towards this if it helps the planet. I am not hopeful, however, that other generations before mine would do the same.

The documentary Minimalism records that in today's highest level of material life, people blindly live for material feeling empty, constantly spending money to satisfy endless desires. At the same time, someone is waking up: the minimalist. They gradually understand the obstacles to people's lives. In order to reduce the dependence on materials, they deliberately reduce the material in life, use less resources to live, and advocate the daily life to do the subtraction, simplify life. Less stuff leads to less chaos and stress, less debt and dissatisfaction, and less anxiety in life. It also leads to more time, more meaningful relationships, more growth, more contribution and satisfaction, less material consumption and even better environmental protection. Therefore, this documentary calls on people to learn to fill the emptiness and desire brought by materials with confidence and goals, and to become purposeful pragmatism. Only by loving others and using things can people live a happier life.

I was not sure what to expect out of the film “Minimalism” when I started watching it. A couple of minutes in though, I was really intrigued. Whenever I thought about minimalism, I thought of it more as in a way that you dress or in the way that you decorate your home. Continuing with the film, I was able to see how living a minimalist life transformed the lives of many people. I can see why their life was changed; instead of constantly worrying about things that they could buy that might potentially bring them some sort of happiness, they got rid of things that brought no value to their life and started only worrying about what brings them actual joy. 
<br><br>
 Although living a minimalist lifestyle would be good for the environment and maybe even make me happier, I don’t know if I could ever do it. I just have this weird attachment to things or it would be hard to give up some stuff. I think what I can do, and many other people like me, is to try to buy things that will give us satisfaction or value. I know that I do sometimes just buy things just to buy something, not because I really wanted it. The stories of these people living like this, not because they have to, but because they want to, is the answer to a first world problem. The montages of people at black Friday are so scary; people will literally wrestle each other to the ground just for an item. I don’t think that it ever has to go to that extreme. I think the part that astounded me the most is that some of these people gave up six figure paying jobs in order to be happy. They would rather not have as many things or live lavishly in order to enjoy their life. 
 <br><br>
 Although, again, the film doesn’t outwardly talk about the climate crisis, this is a way that could potentially lower one’s carbon footprint. I think it helps lower the amount of things someone buys and how they don’t add to the consumer culture that leads to the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Many people will argue that this way of living isn’t for them, and it’s totally okay, but I think that we could all cut down on constantly buying things for the chances of it bringing some self-fulfillment.

Having already seen the documentary, " Minimalism”, I took the opportunity to watch the two short films that Ken provided. "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism" are both videos by the Center for a New American Dream. I feel that both of the films compliment each other exceptionally well, the first describes a solution for our consumerist culture while the other describes the consequences and problems with materialism as well as another potential solution. 
<br><br>

“Visualizing a Plentitude Economy” starts by reviewing the most shocking statistics of the 2008 Recession, it discusses the trillions of dollars of debt and the eight million people who lost their jobs. However, most notable is the fact that the wealthiest five percent of the culture accumulated sixty-five percent of the country’s wealth during this recession. The solution to this unequal wealth distribution that this video presents is called a Plentitude Economy, it states that “Changing how we spend our time” is the key to reducing the environmental impact on the planet. The main idea behind this thinking is that employers need to employ more people for shorter shifts as “fairer distribution of work leads to a fairer income distribution” and this will lead to the development of “savvy economics” where people can live better with less money. By building social capital, this provides an alternative to our current consumer culture. 
<br><br>

I feel that this is a great solution for our materialistic society but the standard would need to be held for all individuals, it would not be enough for the “blue-collar” workers of society to adapt this Plentitude Economy. CEOs, Bankers, Lawyers, and all the other high-income individuals in society would also need to distribute their income. This type of economy would only be successful if everyone does their part. I feel that the effects of the Plentitude Economy would be very positive but would not be felt for many years and only after all members of the population adopt the practices. 
<br><br>

“The High Price of Materialism" combats the statement that “Good Life is attainable through the goods life” and discusses the commercialization and consumerization of our current society. It discusses the effects of our current materialistic lifestyle on our outlook on life, social relationships, and our attitudes towards the environment. The solution that the video provides is the promotion of Intrinsic values over Materialistic values. Intrinsic values focus on the growth of others as well as the self and to promote personal, social, and ecological wellbeing. 
<br><br>

However, I feel that this solution would be far more difficult to implement in our modern society. While the promotion of intrinsic values is a noble cause, the video makes it clear that it would come at the expense of commercialization and consumerization. Given the amount of money spent annually on advertising and promotions, this would lead to the loss of many jobs as well as profits and incomes for companies. This would likely be too radical of a change for society and would not be well received by those with power and influence. So, while I do agree with this more optimistic and growth-based outlook on life, it seems more like “wishful thinking” that a realistic solution.

Minimalism has to be my favorite film so far. There were a lot of takeaways from the feature. In my opinion, a very moving scene comes when the man is describing buying all the “basics” from IKEA. This introduced a long list of items that are not actually basics. Leather chairs and leather accessories are what majority of the furniture in my family home consist of. In fact much of what was shown is in my house; espresso machines, carpets, heck even stainless steel picture frames. It really made me question my parent’s generation and what they were thinking as they were the ones that purchased all of these items. In addition, I was also captivated by the thought of how the millennial have got to be far worse off than my parents. With social media and picture taking becoming more and more prominent, the aesthetic and style of your apartment are becoming more important. Will this painting look good in the back of my snapchat? Millennial are the ones creating espresso machines and toaster ovens and heating drawers. Millennial are so reliant on technology that they will be purchasing even more than our naïve parents. Millennial have never and will never be minimalists. 
<br><br>
Oh man did the scene where he unpacked what he was taking with him for ten weeks make me feel bad about myself. The answer is yes. Leading up to that, he discussed how the few clothes he did own were his favorite clothes and I have never even thought of that. As sexist as this sounds I do think it is easier to be a minimalist as a male. Look at makeup and how many different products women are forced to purchase to pull off different looks. Also, social media has made it almost socially unacceptable to wear clothes more than once. 
<br><br>
Finally, towards the end of the movie a woman discusses the “junk culture” that consumes us. This could not be more accurate. Even when I was a kid I remember seeing toys that were advertised and thinking “that is such a waste of money.” Until today, it never occurred to me that not only was it a waste of money but also a waste to the environment. We have got to put an end to the junk culture.

<p>
After watching the film "Minimalism" I felt very intrigued to try this practice to some extent. Personally, I feel like I could not be able to live the minimalist lifestyle completely, as I feel like I am attached to some of my material belonging. However, I feel like up to a certain extent I could get rid of some things. For, example I feel like I could get rid of some clothes and shoes that I have that I do not wear as often. Also, I feel like I have plenty of books that I have already read and are just sitting around my house. I do feel like I could donate some belongings. However, for me I feel like it would be extremely hard to live my life as the film shows. 
<br><br>
I found very interesting how the whole concept of minimalism grew. At the beginning of the movie, they talked about how they did presentation where only two people showed up, but they were still pleased to share their ideas with them. However, as I watched the movie I could tell how more and more people started showing up at their events, and where really interested in hearing about the minimalism way of life. I found this interested because in the society that we live in, which is extremely materialistic,  I would not expect a lot of people to be willing to spend their time hearing about this lifestyle, let alone actually try it.
</p><hr>

<p>
The film "Minimalism" is very inspiring and motivating in terms of urging people to live with less. Every individual in the film had all came to a consensus in their lives that they truly did not need so much stuff. That they can live with less stuff. That they are happier with less stuff. I think this is an extremely admirable way to live, to cut down your individual carbon footprint by owning less things, less space, less distractions. The film reminded me of a documentary I had watched about living on minimum wage, called "30 Days: Living on Minimum Wage". 
<br><br>
When I saw this documentary, it truly opened my eyes, to see how little people are living with, how many people are barely scraping by. And then I thought about how the rest of us who are well-off, we buy and consume more than what we truly need. We buy more food than we can finish and then throw it away. We buy more clothes than we can wear and then toss it when it is "out of season". We own more stuff that have no use than what has a use in our lives. If we could all cut down our consumption, and share it, we can help those that are struggling to make ends meet.
<br><br>
I admit that I also need to decrease my own consumption and strive to live more minimally. 

<br><br>
I regularly give into consumerism of the fashion industry, buying new shirt, new jackets, even though I have enough for myself. I always want to buy something that I think is cool, even though there isn't even that much practical use for it. And after watching this documentary, I will also strive to live like a minimalist.

<p>
As shown in the film, minimal life can bring change to the environmental change. It was hard for me to connect these two topics before I watched this film. But after watching this film, my mind was opened by it. Nowadays, humans are too materialistic. We pursue money and become crazy for money. Money can do many things. And the desire for money is caused by the desire for material. We always feel unsatisfied by the things we have now. It is common to see that when we go to the market, we only plan to buy something we need, but when we see something looks good or very cheap in sale. It is easy for us to become irrational and buy things that are not on our plan. So minimal life means reduce the things we consume to the basic level that we need for survival and reduce the things that are unnecessary. Which means, the quantity of consumption is reduced. The need to produce them reduced. So the factories will consume less material that they need to produce the products, such as land, water, and vegetables, which means a protection to the earth.  So the change of lifestyle is able to bring change to the earth. In this film, when I find that people who change their lifestyle to minimal life become happier and more satisfied, I feel curious and excited about this lifestyle. I am wondering if I live in this style, will I become happier? And at the same time, I can do a small part to solve this climate issue. That would be a great change. So I would give this film 5 stars, because it changed my idea and had a positive influence on my mind. It even  caused me to change my lifestyle. So it will change other’s minds too. It should be an influential film.

<p>
Although I agreed with the arguments presented in “Visualizing a Plentitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism” overall, I think that changing policy would be hard for the average person to really contribute to. Yes, we can turn on Ad Block, but arguing for less advertisements in public schools and other public spaces seems like a big battle, given the 150 billion dollars funding consumerism. “The good life is attainable through the goods life” and the idea that we always need to be working are deeply ingrained in our culture. I hope that art will effectively aid this minimalist movement soon. (I attended a workshop called “Art in Organizing” at a Social Justice Conference yesterday. There, I learned that there are two ways to change a person’s beliefs: 1) mind-to-mind or 2) heart-to-heart. Appealing to one’s emotions is much more effective than using logic and reason. Art evokes emotions.) I am glad that the documentary "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" is on Netflix for others to experience.
</p><hr>

<p>
Matt D’Avella’s “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” introduces to the viewer the concept of minimalism and the benefits of living minimalistically in a society that’s been plagued by the idea that more success and more stuff  results in more happiness. This ideology coerces us and forces us to strive towards the unnecessary, which in turn, doesn’t allow individuals to truly appreciate and enjoy what really matters. This unhealthy consumer mentality not only negatively affects our emotional well-being, it’s a disservice to the climate crisis. Refraining from buying luxury is the right step towards reducing our carbon footprint.
<br><br>
Additionally, watching this film made me realize that I should tone down my need for the material. Not only would it positively impact my mental health, it would also benefit the impact I have on the planet.

I also had the same realization. This film showed me that minimalism is more than just possessions but not only that but focusing on and practicing the fundamentals instead of wasting time, money, on excess things. Minimalism is a lifestyle that can help you with success, productivity, being more creative, and willpower. It is simply eliminating the things that distract you from the essential. Minimalism can also lead to happiness. To live a meaningful life, being able to create and contribute to the world or to a community is a foundation for living a healthy and happy life. While our generation is still live, we are the ones that can control what we contribute to the planet especially for climate change. For example, cooking a meal instead of buying one can save you money and can make you feel productive. The time and energy we waste on things like social media. Do we really need 5+ social media apps on our phones? One of the biggest things about living a minimalist life is priorities. Being able to do your priorities on time and efficiently doing that task can make you feel better as a person. Setting yourself goals can help maintain focus on your priorities in life. For example, setting a goal for the grades you want to achieve, how much you plan on studying everyday, and how much money needed to spend every week.

I’ve always found the minimalist lifestyle to be so interesting; tiny houses on YouTube vlogs had adorable and modern exteriors and limiting the number of things in the house by utilizing multi-purpose products seemed so awesome to me. I was constantly reminded of the Netflix show “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo” because 1) The Minimalists kept saying “spark joy” and 2) the premise of the Netflix show is basically what the Minimalists were advocating. I would definitely consider minimalism as a primary lifestyle not just for me, but to limit myself in my carbon footprint and save more financially. Even if I personally want to live in this type of lifestyle, I don’t see other Americans creating this lifestyle change for the sole purpose of living with a reduced carbon footprint because it comes with so many sacrifices of giving up comfortability. If actual depressed people found happiness living clutter-free then I’m up for it. Like, do people really need half the things that they possess? I don’t need half of my things, they do not spark joy in my heart, and it just makes me feel even messier. 
<br><br>
As the documentary emphasized, living with minimal things in our lives can bring happiness to those who were struggling in their lives which I found interesting. Only in America (and other first world countries), can an issue such as depression from materialism exist.  At the beginning of the film, I was wondering why I was watching a documentary about minimalist living in my English 23 class instead of my Psych 1 class because of the psychological effects of consumerism and the many featured neuropsychologists who were interviewed for the documentary. But the message of reducing an individual’s carbon footprint while relating it to the issue of climate change was effective. Ken’s lecture video on the climate crisis as a cultural problem connected with the message of the documentary; sometimes convenience is not convenient to the environment or in our daily life.

I went into this film unsure about how this film would take on minimalism because I didn’t know much about minimalism other than reading stories about tiny houses and such. Once I started watching it though I was captivated and actually very interested in it. It explained the problems of American consumerism and linked the American dream to our overconsumption and its link to environmentalism. It made the stories very personal as it delved into people’s lives and their own exploration of climbing the corporate ladder with dreams of making the most money to buy the most stuff they could, only to realize that they weren’t actually happy with their lives. The story that captivated me was the man who was the former Wall Street Broker and had the opportunity to have the “American dream” by being a junior partner at his firm and he walked away from it because that would have been his whole life. I have thought about that predicament multiple times as I feel so many people are trapped in jobs that consume their lives just so they can try to make the most amount of money in order to buy things that are supposed to compensate for the life lost in order to purchase it. People are so caught up in making money that their whole lives are passing them by- travel, relationships, everyday enjoyment. Capitalism has created a feedback loop of wanting to make money in order to purchase things due to the lifestyles advertised by those at the top. Consumerism has completely enveloped American culture as items are so easily purchased and thrown away because it is seen as normal. I think a big part of the consumerism and throwaway culture seen in America is due to the lack of full cost pricing. The film mentioned how we are paying artificially low costs for clothes and other items due to the sweatshop conditions in other countries for our consumption. If we actually paid the full costs for our clothes, food, and other items we would all probably reduce our consumption or rethink throwing things away so quickly. 
<br><br>
This film not only discussed minimizing your consumption, but about having the purchases and decisions you make really count and add value to your life. That message really resonated with me and made me reevaluate what I buy and the decisions I make. This film made me want to change my lifestyle and be more conscious about how I live my life. I recognize that I am just as much a part of the problem, caught up in consumerist culture with fast fashion and buying meaningless things. I think everyone should watch this movie because it truly has made me realize how caught up we all are in the wheel of capitalism and not making conscious decisions about what I want with my life. I believe people just aren’t as aware and have a false consciousness. We need to be able to step out of our bubble so we can change the culture and environmentally degrading lifestyles we live.

Minimalism is a great documentary film that shows many different issues surrounding consumerism and capitalism, as well as the benefits of minimalism. One of the most interesting parts of the film, in my opinion, was when the filmmakers began to analyze the fashion industry and the way in which it contributes to the idea of consumerism. Today, as stated in the film, “fast fashion” controls the majority of the fashion industry. Basically, clothes are mass produced many times per year in response to trends, and consumers are encouraged to keep up with these trends and buy more. This cycle plays into our everyday lives and we barely even notice how sinister and controlling it is. I constantly see my friends and others tease each other for wearing something that isn’t “trendy” anymore, and we do this because we are taught that staying with the trends is ideal. Most of the celebrities we look up to who are praised for their fashion are never seen wearing the same clothing twice. According to what the fashion industry tells us, this is ideal. In order to reach that status, we try to buy as big of a variety of shoes and clothing as we can so that we may seem fashionable. Personally, I have way more shoes than I would ever really need, but I convince myself that I need them because they’re trendy and different than my other shoes. What we buy is rarely based on true necessity rather than what retailers tell us we need. I know it is hard to resist the pace of fast fashion, but if we all slowed down a little bit and enjoyed the clothing we have until it truly cannot be worn anymore, maybe we could slow down production as well.

I think the film, “Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things,” was important for us to watch. It did not have directly environmental intentions, but it worked to show that you can improve your own life and happiness while simultaneously helping the environment. Joshua and Ryan took us on a fascinating journey. We learned how wired we are to need “stuff” to fill a void and how quickly we become dissatisfied with that stuff and need more. It was crazy to learn how much advertising has infiltrated our culture and supported our addictive consumerism. Advertisements have become so manipulative; they mentioned the huge percentage geared directly towards children, knowing their parents will have a hard time saying no to their child’s wishes. They also discussed the template of the “American Dream,” like Ken talked about in lecture. The idea that an enormous house, multiple cars, and a big family is the goal. The film traced it back to its origins. At some point it became the norm to buy the biggest home you could afford, but by afford it meant what the biggest loan could get you. People fall into debt to live in these huge homes where they use only a small percentage of the space. The documentary describes the more sustainable option of downsizing. Having just enough space means a more social and useable living situation and leaving less of a footprint. 
<br><br>
 The main selling point Joshua and Ryan use on their tour is the increase in happiness minimalism brings. The film used Jim Carrey’s quote, “I wish everyone could become rich and famous so they could realize it’s not the answer.” The tour describes how simplifying your life and ridding yourself of excess things decreases the overwhelm and increases your overall well-being. Living for a paycheck is not living at all! Focusing on what truly adds value to your life rather than fitting into a certain template is crucial to living your best life. We are all looking for what we can personally and instantly get out of something, and this film shows us that cutting down our consumerism will do that and significantly help the environment in the long run.

Similarly I found "Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things" to be extremely important for our class to watch. I also found it disheartening to see the extent of advertising in today's society. Once again we see targeting of children for malicious purposes, and I find it absolutely appalling that the children of our society are constantly being manipulated and shaped into these societal constructs. It's sad to think that even us as children were exposed to this kind of mental manipulation. We're trained to think that we need the best of everything, and that we need to collect as much "cool" stuff as we can in order to feel satisfied with ourselves and our lives. No, this film is not explicitly environmentally focused, but the underlying concepts that reside in this documentary definitely can apply to the way we approach environmental ideas and issues. Not only can you find yourself in minimalism, but while doing so you're also becoming a more sustainable human being. They go hand in hand in my opinion. I also agree that living for a paycheck is not the answer at all. I would rather not have much and have amazing experiences with amazing people, than have millions of dollars but have nothing to show for. The volume of stuff you have doesn't mean anything if you're not truly happy with your experiences. While being minimalistic is environmentally friendly, it isn't just a good thing for the environment, its a good thing for your wellbeing overall as well.

From this documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things”, I heard about “minimalism” for the first time, which is opposite to “materialism” in the movie. In my opinion, to make “minimalism” come true, we are supposed to live in a simpler way, buy less, and consume less. Although I have known about the basic action under this motion, I was surprised by the woman who just with 33 items for entire 4 years. Actually I have to admit that in my wardrobe, there are definitely more than 33 items even for one season, so I cannot imagine how she can complete this achievement. But things turn out that I do not need that much clothes in my life in fact, I am also one of typical consumers and it is time to make a difference in my life after watching this film. Like “Being the Change”, meditation is also introduced in this movie to deeply think about the true happiness. I consider Joshua and Ryan’s speech and book tour as extremely successful because they gain a lot of support after that and their books are widespread so that more and more people would know about this kind of lifestyle then live in this way, find the true happiness. Another thing that is worthy of our reflection is advertisement towards kids talked about at the end of this movie, by playing somewhat violent or cartoon videos, sales volume of products aiming at kids shot up in recent 2 decades but those products are very useless. After all, all phenomenon that is talked about in this movie should be attached importance to find a more proper lifestyle for Americans.

The video introduces the concept of minimalism. After reading it, we really have a new understanding of the word. In the description of the concept, people only need to be self-sufficient, not to work so long, earn so much money, and want so many things. As mentioned in the video of the high price of material list, material list actually has a high cost. People are always influenced by advertisements in various public places, and constantly yearn for more materials and products. At the same time, the video also calls for reducing the number of advertisements in public places as a solution. The video also shows that countries such as France have begun to pay more attention to the good relationship between citizens and communities, rather than GDP, so as to better enable citizens to make good contributions to society.
<br><br>
However, I don't think the practicability of minimalism is certain. In theory, it can make people happier and pay less work and energy. But now the pace of development of the whole world is too fast. If we can't slow down to realize minimalism at the same time, it will easily lead to the disconnection with the world's pace, so I don't think the possibility of this concept is good.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have never really thought of minimalism as a viable way to live life. Whenever I though about it, I pictured people living in tiny houses with no space for anything. I did not make sense to me that a person could live with so little. Now, when I take a close look, and thanks to this movie, it kind of makes sense. As humans, we really need only enough to survive. I also just makes practical sense. Why do I need a closet full of clothes that I will never wear, or a house full of things I never use? I guess you could call it convenience, but is it really worth it to have something you will use maybe once or twice? I personally do not think so. I think the fashion industry is a perfect example of this. As the movie pointed out some designers will literally destroy their old clothes so people have to buy the new ones. That is just so manipulative and greedy. They know anytime they release new clothes, people are going to buy them and people just soak it all up. They might wear them once or twice, but after the clothes are out of style, they are worthless, like actually have no monetary value anymore. The american consumerism is unprecedented. No where else in the world are people so driven and consumed by it. You could make a case for places in Europe, but where did they learn it. If what these men say is true and you can be happier with less, it makes sense. You are not being a pawn in the trillion dollar business of consumerism anymore and that must feel pretty good.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” has was been my favorite film we have watched this quarter. It was captivating and very motivating, making me want to try my best to be more of a minimalist. The comment about the American Dream being A template but not THE template was a good reminder. As someone who came into UCSB as an Economics major and became unhappy, I fully agree with this. I switched to Political Science because it is something that I am passionate about, not just something that I know will help me make a lot of money after college. This movie was a good reminder of what is truly important in life and that our big houses, new phones, and latest trendy clothing does not fulfill us. After watching the movie I definitely want to go through my own belongings and donate items. 
<br><br> 
I was shocked that in 2006, there was a 17 billion dollar industry that marketed to children. This served as a reminder that we all live in a consumer driven society. Hearing this made me feel disappointed in society and our tendency to base our worth off of what we own. As a college student in Santa Barbara, one of the richest cities in America, I have to do a better job of being a minimalist. I often call myself an environmentalist but don’t act like one. Making small decisions everyday to use less material items and spend more time with others is a conscious choice that doesn’t take much. The film ended by saying, “Love people and use things, the opposite never works”. I believe this was a good ending to the film, reminding us of what is important in life. Our hard work and material goods don’t mean anything if we aren’t happy.

I watched the two videos by 'New Dream" and what really stuck out to me, and as Ken also mentioned in this intro video is that we have to do more than just individual changes. What we really need to attempt is a shift as a society and community. Will it be successful? I hope so, because we're honestly running out of other options. The plenitude economy that was explained in the first video sounds like a much better life than most of us are living now. I feel like all of the problems we complain about like long work weeks, heavy traffic or commutes to work and crowded grocery stores, etc could be solved by the plenitude economy. It would give people more time to take a breath and appreciate their life, their family, possibly even nature and other organisms we share the planet with. I think many people believe 'time is money', but that goes back into the greedy and never satisfied mentality of consumer and commercial based society. The time we are given on this planet can and should be used for volunteering, helping others, planting gardens, hiking, biking, spending time with family and friends. The reason switching to a whole new economic system is more likely to make a difference is because we can all work together to mitigate climate change. If a few people decide to live a minimalistic lifestyle by making changes like owning less stuff, having no car, and living in a tiny home then there won't be a big enough impact if everyone else continues to have such a high value on materials, which will never be satisfied. Another aspect of minimalism that is important to understand is where all our 'stuff' comes from. A majority is made by women and children in developing countries, in dangerous factories. If we really want to help the planet there shouldn't be such a disconnect between the human species as a whole, we need to learn to coexist. If we buy less than the hours of working and working conditions could be improved for these people who are making all our clothes and toys, etc. They deserve better lives just as much as we do and they also deserve to feel safe and not constantly threatened by the effects of climate change that they're not even causing. I do think that minimalism is going to be a viable solution for many Americans, but unfortunately I also think it will make most people uncomfortable and stand-offish. Something that might make the changes more serious is if we can vote and change some policies to put this movement into effect for real.

While watching this documentary I have to admit I felt very guilty. I never thought about the effect that consumerism had on my life and how much I rely on materialistic stuff. Our society has shaped us to believe that success and happiness is the idea of having a big house, tons of cars, etc, thus while growing up we look up to have all those things and if we do not achieve any of that, we become depressed and lose self-confidence. 
<br><br>
Minimalists demonstrate that having enough and actually enjoying what you have it’s what gives us happiness.This culture of consumerism goes back generations, but it has worsened and I do not know what to hope for future generations. Nowadays we see two-year-olds with full understanding of ipads and electronics; we are educating children in a materialistic world that instead of chasing happiness wants to chase  a six figure check. In addition, advertisements play a huge role. It shocked me to see that 17 million dollars are spent in marketing for children, but honestly it makes sense. I remember when I was a kid and Christmas season was approaching, I would turn on the TV, watch the ads and write my wish list. Or parents of course want to give us the best, so they think the best is what is material and forget about the value of sharing memories. Now, looking back I do not even remember a third of what I got for Christmas back then. It has become the way our lives work, we rely on materialistic stuff to be happy. It scares me because I do not know if there is a way we can fix this, the mentality that we grow up with. We can only apply our knowledge into our own lives and raise our kids with these same values. “Human identity is not defined for what one does, but rather by what one posses”, our society pushes us to believe that and then it just becomes part of us. I now realized how much materialism blinds me from the real value of life and the value and happiness that our loved ones bring to us. 
<br><br>
Minimalism is a life of less, but more. At the end, when we die we won't take anything with us but the fulfilment of living a plentiful life with memories that go with us forever. I completely loved the ending, “ Love people and use things because the opposite never works”.

So, there were a few things about this documentary I want to touch on. Primarily, I want to say I think there is a good message here and that the minimalists have good intentions. However, I didn’t like how the whole time everyone was saying you can’t have money and be happy or having and buying things doesn't create happiness. Which in some cases, yes that's true. But also there are a lot of people out there who have money who are also very happy so to totally dismiss that side of the story and say that you have to have minimal things and you can't have a lot of money to be happy just seems very one sided and bias. I do agree that in many cases people who have money are also extremely unhappy, but I think it's very circumstantial. I also didn’t like how the minimalists made the documentary very about themselves and how what they did is the right thing to do and how everyone needs to do it. Everyone is a different person and everyone lives their own life. Regarding the environmental issues, which pertain more to this class, I think that being a minimalist is (obviously) a very good think thing to do and we should all try to cut down on the amount of things we buy. However, the documentary didn't really talk a lot about the environmental side and just talked about the emotional side to getting rid of unnecessary junk. Don’t get me wrong, I did like the message and the documentary I just feel like they could have taken a different approach to explaining minimalism.

After watching the film “Minimalism,” I was reminded of when I had to take the Ecological Footprint Calculator Quiz for another ES class. This quiz along with this movie have completely shifted my perspective on how we use the Earth's resources and the true scale of how much we need to live a “happy” life. According to this quiz it would take 2 Earths to provide enough resources to sustain life the way I am living. This fact alone was terrifying as I try to live a more eco friendly lifestyle. While it ONLY took 2 Earths to sustain my lifestyle it took others 6 or 7. The film opened my eyes to the amount of unnecessary items I own and it does a good job showing how societies increase in the consumption of goods is is damaging our planet’s environment and hindering the amount of resources we have and our overall comfort for the future. While we rely on a lot of material items, the Earth simply cannot sustain the way of life we all desire to live. As our population continues to quadruple Earth’s tipping point, our demands for goods and services increases eventually leading to the total stripping of resources. We all need to follow the advice of living a more minimalist lifestyle as it is beneficial to everyone and everything. Our happiness should not rely on the amount of items we possess.

I took this exact same test in my biology class during freshman year. But, I remembered that we took a test as a class and my teacher took incites from everybody in answering the quiz. The class concluded that it would take 9 Earths for our planet to be able to sustain our current way of life. I think the result of that test was more precise because it reflected the interactions seen by first years coming up in the adolescent stage, who are fresh from the biases of the society. The goal of this test is to pinpoint how many earths we need to be able to sustain an ideal way of living and what's ideal needs to be changed. 
<br><br>
The film reflects on our tendencies on finding happiness on the consumption of things. In fact it's even quoted as an addiction. This tendencies reflect the paradigms enforced by our capitalist society.
<br><br>
A major idea that I took from this film is that a most of our obsessions are not towards the actual materiality of the things we own but towards its symbolic value. We call it hype nowadays. And, the media and basically everything around us strain it as an addiction. Profit-driven corporations have formulated profiles and data for each one of us to target our addictions without our knowing. However, this is only possible because we allow them to dictate our wants and needs. This film teaches us that we should focus on finding real value of the things we own, do we actually need it? or do we just want it. And remember, what you want is usually dictated by what everyone around you wants.

I think the film is effective at communicating its idea that Minimalism is a beneficial way to control people’s consuming appetite and own a happier and satisfying spiritual world. The narrators, Josh and Ryan, have already succeeded in their field and owned considerable income. However, satisfying material life did not give them a sense of fulfillment and happiness. After they became minimalists, they minimize their substantial needs and make the world and their inner world better places. The film advocated people not to consume things blindly but follow a minimal lifestyle, including living in smaller houses, buying fewer clothes, and consuming fewer cars. It displays several examples of people who follow minimalism and they are actually experiencing happier and healthier lives than before. I think the audience of the film is people who unfamiliar with minimalism since the idea of minimalism is quite new to the crowds. The narrator utilizes persuasive examples of people with different vocations and literacy, creating similarities between audience and examples. After watching the film, I am inspired by minimalism that people may achieve better lives and the environment by minimizing their material needs. Also, most things we bought are useless and harmful to nature as a whole. However, the current situation is pessimistic since almost all social media are communicating the idea of materialism and encouraging people buying things all the time. They only care about short-term profits instead of thinking about the climate crisis or deforestation caused by massive production. The film changed my attitude that minimalism does not introduce an extreme action but tell us people can make small changes in their lifestyles in order to make the world a better place.

I agree with you.We are in a strange world that teaches us incorrect values. It tries to persuade us the good life is equal to "the goods life". It encourages us to own more stuff in order to become happier. However, once we fall into this lie, we are left with bad emotions--anxiety, depression, and angry. When I was in middle school, I used to observe the shoes of my classmates. If I saw their cool shoes, I would beg my parents to buy me the same one. But this kind of idea is hard to be satisfied. I was not happy when I wore shiny shoes. This was because I was thinking about the new one. Sometimes companies employ such thought of customers to make more money. They create advertisements targeted at different age groups. In order not to be deceived by these tricks, we need to promote intrinsic value as mentioned by the video. Volunteering is one effective example. When your heart is filled by

I always thought of minimalism as an aesthetic, but not a lifestyle. I would see it as less decorations is more, but did not realize people implemented that into all. aspects of their life.
<br><br>
One part of the movie that stuck out to me was Joshua’s poem / story. It was about how he lost his mother and divorce around the same time and as a new bachelor, he was moving into his new apartment and thinking of all the things he needed, from the necessities to what society believes is needed, but really is not. This greatly relates to my experience with dorm and visiting furniture stores. For my dorm room, I brought so many things over, barely fitting everything in the back of my family car after folding up the backseats, and something like Project 333 would have saved me. All of those clothes here and I wear the same four jeans every day and there are specific tops that I brought “just in case” I change my mind about them. Even decorating, I dropped $50 just for flowers and a tapestry that were poor quality and I changed my mind on. The movie honestly did a phenomenal job connecting to the audience because there were plenty of other parts outside of this that I related to.
<br><br>
David and Jacqueline’s apartment was really cool and with how functional the space was, it made me reconsider owning a house, at least right away, when I am older. It had everything that a living space needs. Consumerism exposes the ugly side of humanity. We buy and work tirelessly for short term happiness or even for bragging rights. It reminds me of the Ariana Grande’s song, 7 rings. “I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.” The message behind this song isn’t the best in reflection. It embodies capitalism and the idea of having a lot of riches. Society’s relationship with things is so negative. An example is Black Friday and the clip featured in the documentary. Everyone runs in and another woman snatched a box from a child, causing them to go back and forth, and the woman then acts as a victim and exclaims, “Why are you being so aggressive? You’re scaring me!” It’s this toxic obsession with unfulfilling purchases that leave people treating each other so poorly, even towards  a mother and a child. Another example of how entrapping and useless this lifestyle is is how iPhones are switched out every few years with a new upgrade or feature. Because of this, prior versions are seen as not as good, despite having the same functionality. It’s this mindset we have to cut off. I find minimalism to be a cute aesthetic, but an even better way of living.

I think that the makers and subjects of this film simply have the right idea: Love people and use things. I completely believe that minimalism is a viable and meaningful option to not only reduce one’s carbon footprint but to seriously improve one’s way of living and increase overall happiness. Although I know this is a radical statement, I feel like the minimalism approach takes a majority of issues were currently facing as a species and legit just solves them. Climate change, increased depression rates, loss of family values, loss of community values, you name it, minimalism might just be able to help it. I am aware that reducing the number of items you own won’t literally solve all worldly issues overnight, but it seems like a damn good place to start. 
<br><br>
So many people are working for hours upon hours each day to buy pounds upon pounds of stuff, only to be told that the stuff they bought is no longer on trend and they need to go out and buy more stuff, and it’s ridiculous! What is the point? You spend time away from your family and stress yourself to death basically, and for what? So you can have the new iPhone X or some headphones that don’t even have a cord attached? No, that’s not living. Living doesn’t require a huge house or a gazillion of the newest gadgets, just look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs for reference. On the bottom level is physiological needs (think air, water, food), followed by safety needs (property, health, personal security), up next is love and belonging (self explanatory), then esteem (self esteem, strength, freedom), and lastly self actualization (literally the desire to become the most that one can be). Nowhere on this pyramid does it say money or status or Ferrari or iPad, yet, as seen in the film, people don’t realize that they’re trapped in a system that wants them to think you need these superficial things to be happy! Every person in this film who had adjusted their lives to be more minimalistic generally appeared happier and more connected to the people around them than those portrayed glued to their phones or in a Black Friday battle. Minimalism could potentially be the key to freeing us from our own self constructed “matrix” we have all found ourselves trapped in, and I for one am going to use it to get out there and really live life the right way.

I enjoyed watching the film: “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things”. The film gives a wide variety of reasons why people choose to live in a minimalist way like “find your happiness”. I think living in such a way definitely lowers one’s footprint. However, minimalism is less likely to become trendy because of consumerism. Things that are unnecessary have become “necessary” to satisfy our addiction to buy objects. You get promotions every day. 50% off on this, 40% off on that. The discounts trick us to think as if we are gaining that discounted percent when we buy the for sale products. When I see my favorite sneaker is on sale, I would dash to the store and get it even I have ten pairs of sports shoes already. Similar to Ryan Nicodemus’ idea, we create our own feelings of void and emptiness. If there has to be a change it has to be ourselves to make that first step. Bring your own grocery bag to a shop, stop being manipulated by the discounts, and fill up that empty mind glass with something more meaningful.

I agree that the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" gives many reasons why people should lead a minimalistic lifestyle and that it will stay as untrendy as it is because of a material culture we have built ourselves on. Every morning when I check my inbox, I'm overwhelmed with emails for 30% off of clothing, 10% off of makeup, etc that entice the consumer with discounts and a FOMO on the newest styles and the best deals. We're constantly being fed a script of buying the newest and latest everything without any thought into what goes into making a product, what the real impact is. And that's what I think is the most important about minimalism, it encourages people to remove themselves from that mindset and invest themselves in something more fulfilling. It is more of a first-world approach to a first-world problem but I think progress and changed mindsets are always a step in the right direction. Filling ourselves up with meaningful and valuable things rather than material goods can lead to a rewarding lifestyle and encourage others to do the same.

I completely agree with the fact that the trend of consumerism exists but also in the mass destruction it had done to our earth and mindsets. We, as humans, believe that our measure of success and wealth is through materialistic objects. The more we buy the better we feel. This is an inaccurate mindset to what true happiness is which is filling your life with things that you absolute need, people that love you and activities you enjoy. We have allowed corporate America to convince us that we need solely name brand items and a lot of them to make it in this country. This film, "Minimalism: A Documentary About Important Things" is a great example of how little things one needs to live off of and how much more that benefits the earth. As you mentioned, small steps that we as everyday consumers can take is using a reusable grocery bag, cup or straw, having more self control around discounts and sales, and overall being more mindful about the effect that each purchase and action has on the earth is a huge step in the right direction of saving the planet from the climate crisis.

This film has made me question what I want in life and more importantly what I want OUT of life. It’s funny, before watching this documentary, I was debating with my brother whether or not I should buy the new airpods. Let me explain: I already own airpods and they are in mint condition, but I keep seeing the new airpods around (either through advertisements or seeing people use them) and I thought to myself, I should get them. But while watching the film, I asked myself, why do I want these new airpods? 
<br><br>
I’m a prime example of never being satisfied with what I have. In fact I’m sitting in a coffee shop on State Street and I was planning to go shopping after I finished my homework as a reward. The United States is a country driven by consumerism and status. I’d agree with the film when it discussed how people are disconnected from society and how we are restless to get our hands on the next best thing. 
<br><br>
It was surprising to me that President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, saw the country’s consumerism as a problem. I was thinking this was an issue that started in the 2000s and was shocked that people have known about this problem for the past 50 years.
<br><br>
One thing that really spoke to me was the problem of fast fashion. It was mind blowing to me that companies don’t have four seasons of clothing but rather fifty two. Every week there is a new trend getting people to go out and buy something. It’s crazy to think that used apparel is considered “worthless.”

I feel like this film was a wake up call for me too. It shed light into the dark truth of our society. We’re obsessed with getting the newest electronic device, the fastest car, the trendiest clothes. We fail to recognize our wasteful and discontent nature. As Ken said, “Minimalism is a first-world solution to a first-world problem.” Other, less affluent societies don’t face the problem of having too much stuff. However, manufactured goods are mass produced in factories, which makes them completely at our disposal. 

<br><br>
The problem is fundamentally interwoven into the workings of our country. The US is enamored by the idea of the American Dream, which is the belief that anyone, regardless of their status or class, can become successful and that social mobility is possible. By what means are these goals achieved? Capitalism. Most of the things we do are for the end goal of getting money and living comfortably, which for most Americans, means having a lot of unnecessary stuff. Now, I’m not saying having stuff means being a hoarder, but if we’re honest with ourselves, a good chunk of what we own isn’t vital to our survival. It makes sense that Jimmy Carter identified America’s consumerism issue – it’s been a problem since the beginning. But as industrialization and productivity increased, the issue became much more apparent and consuming. 
<br><br>

This movie was pretty eye opening for me as well. Whenever I thought of minimalism, I would picture the stark white and gray interiors that pop up on my Pinterest feed. Before, minimalism was a trend and a style – an aesthetic people sought to achieve. I realize now that it’s a lifestyle. It’s not just cool, but it’s a conscious choice to seek after less and find contentment in what we need, not what we want.

This documentary really made me think about how many of my belongings I actually use and need. When I was evacuated due to the fires in Southern California in 2018, I needed to pack a suitcase of everything I wanted to keep, just in case our house burned down. When I was done packing all of the clothes and items I absolutely needed, I realized that not only did I have a lot of room left in my suitcase, but I also had a lot more clothes and other items that I wasn't going to bring with me. Luckily our house was fine, but when everything was over I really had to think about all the clothes that I never wear and all the stuff I don't use. My family ended up donating a lot of our old toys, books, and clothes to the families who did suffer from the fires. While we did end up using our extra stuff for good, there are some people who don't. In the documentary, it was mentioned that people throw their old clothes in the garbage when they go out of style. I couldn't believe this. I thought most people would donate their old things to charity, but I guess people aren't as good as I thought. I always think twice before I buy something..."When will I use this? Do I really need it? What will this give me?" I think my self control has gotten a lot better due to this hesitation.

I found the film “Minimalism” very interesting. It explains how and why people have chosen to live life this way. I remember a couple of years ago I was visiting family and one of my cousins had decided to be a minimalist. At the time I didn't really know what it was or why people were doing it, so I didn’t really think much about it. But after watching this film I understand that there are a few reasons people become minimalist. First of all, it is good for the environment which I would say most people could assume but what I didn’t know before watching this film is that people do this to let go of the many stresses that come with mass consumption. As Ken said, it is to achieve true freedom. By becoming a minimalist you don't worry about all the material goods that it seems our society has told us will make us happy. You can truly focus on the things that matter like spending time with family and friends. With that said, I don't also think that it is important to mention that just because you’re a minimalist you don't have to give everything up. In the film, they used the example if you have a book collection and you love that book collection it’s okay to keep it. The idea is to keep the things that we really love and make us happy. Watching this film it is easy to realize that many consumer goods we accumulate don't truly make us happy. So in some way shape or form, I think that every person could find a way to live a more minimalist life in which it would improve their lives but also help the environment.

<p>
Minimalism is not a film that I would have chosen to watch out of my own volition but it definitely made me take a step back to reevaluate the actions I participate in that could actually be contributing to the detriment of my own happiness. I watched this film a couple days ago and literally right before I pressed play I had just submitted an online order to get a new pair of pants delivered to me completely out of impulse. There was no necessity that I was fulfilling by ordering these pants or some deep emotional connection that I felt for them as I scrolled aimlessly on the website. Yet still, I went ahead and pressed that order button because I knew it was something exciting for me to look forward to sometime within the next week. I even thought back to all the other times I had impulse bought something online, recalling that short-lived rush of adrenaline I would get seeing a little parcel in front of my front door that quickly faded in the next days as I began searching for the next thing to steal my attention. 
<br><br>
This film was right however in the fact that buying to consumer culture does nothing to truly improve your mental state or level of happiness.  The story  about the man who cried realizing he had spent all of his youth climbing the corporate ladder only to realize it was entrapping him into a cycle of unhappiness really struck me hard since I feel like that pathway has become very common in today's world for the financial gain that it promises, except getting out of the system is not as easy as feeding into it. Happiness is not a commodity that can be satiated with something as simple as a nice house or a nice car. We have been tricked by the American dream to think that success and a good life equates to owning as much as you possibly can without thinking of how this lifestyle impacts us, financially and mentally, and that is definitely something that needs to change.

In all honesty, before watching the video, I viewed most minimalists as Henry David Thoreau: secluded from the public, and only owning what one truly needs to sustain themselves. After watching the video, I see how truly enriching a minimalist lifestyle can be. The film, minimalism reminded me of hunter-gatherer societies that I learned about in my Anthropology class. When comparing the domestic based societies (hunter-gatherer/foraging societies) and capitalist societies, one truly sees which society is more rich. Many of the foraging societies only work for one season a year, harvesting the foods they will need for the season and then continue moving in search of different food and shelter. In these societies, the members of the tribe have more time to build familial bonds and spend time in search of what they truly want in life. In capitalist societies like our own, we are put into a system where we work forty hours a week to afford all the unnecessary junk in our life, that we believe will make us happy. In material goods, we are undoubtedly richer than the foraging societies that still exist today, but in freedom, we are much poorer. 
<br><br>
Isn't it ironic how the United States prides itself on being the land of the free, when many work forty hours a week to fill up their houses with unnecessary junk they think will make them happy, in large houses that they will spend their lives paying off all in the name of the American dream. Is this truly freedom if we have to demonstrate our success in the amount of material goods we can own?
<br><br>
To me, minimalism is about making more space in your life for what makes you happy: family, passions, art, nature, and freeing up the space that was being taken up by meaningless consumer goods. Minimalism is most appealing to me because it gives you the freedom to look at what items are truly adding value to life. Something that adds value to my life, is my clothing and fashion. I really like dressing up, purchasing new outfits, going to thrift stores and finding clothes, and putting an effort into making my everyday outfits. I think when most people hear minimalism, they think it's about depriving yourself from the conveniences of the modern world, but it merely means to get rid of what is not adding value to your life. My clothes are something that are important to me, and add deep value to myself as a person, I see minimalism as only getting rid of the unnecessary fluff in life. I think everyone can practice minimalism even in small steps going forward, I may not stop purchasing clothing, but when making a purchase, I will be sure to ask myself, what does this item add to my life and make more conscious decisions when purchasing consumer goods.

Having already watched "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" (a great film) twice already, I watched "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism," all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. The lifestyle presented by these films is one I know I would love to live, and I believe most people would want to live as well. A 30 hour workweek with much more free time, spending time with loved ones, working a meaningful job - what more could one ask for? Well, some may ask for more money and more things leading them to work more - as well as leading to more depression, anxiety, consumption, and a worse ecological footprint. In 21st century America, our society is soooooooooo built on consumer culture that can sometimes feel like a depressing trap. I am one who really dislikes watching TV, but sometimes I will watch some sports games with my dad or something here and there with my family to spend time with them. I CAN'T BEAR IT WHEN ADS COME ON. I watch my family just mindlessly staring at the TV, absorbing these stupid ads into their brains. They may not like some of the ads themselves as well, but these ads program people subconsciously into the consumer culture and materialism. I personally like to leave when there are ads playing, as I just can't bear to spend my time in a useless way like that. As well as consuming ourselves as a culture, we also become consumed in useless and harmful ways that promote a materialistic culture. I believe it is really important to avoid a ton of advertisements like those on TV, or at least consciously watch them and see the real meaning behind it - how a corporation just wants your money. After consciously looking out for this, it is truly really crazy to see how much our culture is built on materialism like these videos outlined. 
<br><br>
I wholeheartedly agree that we need to focus more on and improve our intrinsic values, which will hopefully be reflected more in our institutions instead of materialism. Instead of politicians focusing so much on the economy and the media blabbering about it all the time, we can be concerned as a society for each other's happiness and well-being.

I watched this film a few years back just as I was beginning to understand environmentalism and the impacts of our personal choices. This film greatly has influenced my life and consumption since, and I believe that minimalism is both a viable and meaningful option. Asking yourself if something adds value to your life, and being entirely truthful with your answer, has a great impact. Cutting down consumption can cause us to look to things that we truly do value instead of meaningless "things" that add little to our lives. We live in a culture that thrives off of instant gratification; the truth is, however, that the things we do to achieve this gratification can often leave us feeling simply more empty in the end.
<br><br>
I appreciate the many different takes on minimalism that appear in this film: from scientists, to architectural design, to meditative practices, to traveling the world with a single bag, to clutter free living; this film shows how minimalism takes more forms than the average idea of it. It depicts it as something that is easily achievable, and something that can start with small steps. While the film is more applicable to lifestyle rather than environmental topics, reducing all that which we consume is truly an environmentalist action: cutting down on the amount that we buy tremendously reduces our waste and carbon footprint. We could all do to become a little more intentional with the things we choose to consume.

This film wasn't my favorite, but it did offer some very important insights into the detriments of hyper-consumerism and the benefits of minimalism. They talk about how the consumerist culture has wired humans to become dissatisfied, which is the fundamental driver of overconsumption. The "fast fashion" model, of promoting cheap, non-lasting, products as weekly trends, has been applied to nearly every consumer industry. This model has contributed to a cultural addiction to keep up with the times, which rapidly changes and renders old products obsolete. This model is inherently unsustainable because it makes people buy stuff they don't need and will hardly ever use/wear, just to fit some idea of how they're supposed to live/look. This hyper-consumerism has created a culture of excess and endless dissatisfaction.  The bit about the 2.2 billion sq ft storage industry, in the US alone, is extremely unsettling. It's disturbing that we have so many useless things, that we have to rent extra spaces to store them in, because we have no immediate need for them. This is the perfect visual representation of our insatiable consumerism. 

<br><br>
Despite the decades of consumerism propelled by the "American Dream," it seems that there a shift in understanding and a growth of counter-cultural consumerism - including the idea of minimalism. People seem to be catching onto the fact that having more money and stuff does not lead to happiness, realizing that they've been tricked. The American Dream was A template, not THE template - it's time to create new one. Minimalism is an attractive lifestyle for many reasons including sustainability, affordability, individual happiness, social well-being, etc. By eliminating the drive to purchase goods in excess, we can drastically reduce their negative environmental impact, and collectively we can reduce our waste. By buying less stuff and living in smaller spaces, we can live off less pay and spend less of our lives working jobs we hate. By reducing clutter and excess, we can eliminate the burden of choice and spend less time making pointless decisions. By living in smaller spaces, we can bring ourselves closer together and improve our social relationships.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” I felt, was the perfect film to follow the reading assignment, “Walden”. Along their journey across the country, Millburn and Nicodemus discover the different takes on minimalist living that show how easy it can be to live simply. I think most important to pay close attention to in the film is the reason this journey began. Both Millburn and Nicodemus lived relatable lives of corporate work, and although they gained more and more, they remained unsatisfied. Similarly, Thoreau realized that the void people felt could not be filled by these material things we can attain in earning more, and  showed us that living simply can be done and lead to the missing satisfaction. The core of harmful consumerism is the concept of ‘demand,’ and yet we are the ones creating the concept in the first place. Our desire for more in hopes of filling the void of dissatisfaction perpetrates the industries causing the most destruction to the planet. As we can see throughout the film, the way to end this incredibly harmful cycle is just to live minimally. Many refuse to even consider this, but it may just be the simplest way to cut down on our negative impact on the planet.

The documentary, Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things was really profound for me. It was very interesting to watch people rejecting society’s norms of consuming more in order to be happy. They found happiness in having less. I also think it is important that we focus on happiness instead of contentment. I believe happiness is fleeting, it is an emotion and we cannot be happy all the time. We are not a game show hostess. Sure, the new LV bag and matching belt will bring you happiness and envy from your peers but will you be content? Will you never buy another bag, pair of shoes, phone, laptop, car or house simply because you already have one? If it is within our reach, people will want more because they can buy more. I think this documentary has affected me personally because I have often questioned my lifestyle choices. Whenever I was asked where do you see yourself in 10 years or what does success look like to you? My replies were the same, an educated woman with a career in which she can travel the world and make a lot of money. To work for a multi-national corporation and climb the corporate ladder to the top, to have a penthouse and sportscars and luxurius vacations to Fiji. To some degree, it is still my goal. I am majoring in Communication and plan on obtaining a Masters in Business so I can get to where I want to be. The statement, “Happiness had to be somewhere around the corner.” really got to me because I have this unshakeable notion that once I graduate college, once I have a good job, a house, a family I will be happy. I will be complete. But what if I’m not? I loved the quote “we create the space to fit our lives”, because I agree that we want more space to fit all of our wildest dreams. The documentary also reminded me of “Into the Wild” in which the character Chris McCandless, a successful and brilliant young man, decides to leave everything behind to live “in the wild.” He leaves everything including his family, girlfriend and a promising future. It’s something I think we have all fantasized with but we know we couldn’t possibly do. I shed tears when Joshua Fields Millburn talked about his mother’s death. He was going through two horrendous events in a single month yet found himself having time to embark on a shopping trip to IKEA. I think we can all learn from this documentary that buying less will not only be good for us as individuals with emotions and feelings but the earth. We spend so much to satiate our thirst but don’t realize our car emits 4.6 metric tons of CO2 a year, that our T-shirt used up 2,700 litres of water and our burger took 831 gallons to make.

When I began to listen to the documentary, I was initially hit with the notion that it was going to be about a lifestyle change and how people hoard a ton of stuff and how if we fix all of that by just getting rid of everything that we own, then the world would be a much better place and that all of us would be happy. However, after watching the documentary, I found something within not only the film, but within myself, that I believed really touched who I was as a person. It was the idea of success. In the film, they talk a lot about the American Dream and what that means. It essentially describes the American Dream as a vision where people who were not as affluent could climb up the socio-economic ladder with hard-work and dedication to their craft. In the end, they would receive a larger paycheck and would have fulfilled their dreams in America. 

<br><br>
However, both the “minimalists” that are the main proprietors of this movement, really go into detail about their pasts, including how they grew up. They mentioned that they did not have much growing up, how their households were broken, how their parents - specifically their moms - would abuse substances. And, when they were growing up, they wanted to make sure that they could be affluent enough in order to avoid those obstacles, and if they could do that, then they would ensure happiness in their own lives. Yet, Ryan describes his time working at a corporate firm as depressing. Joshua and Ryan both worked their whole lives trying to climb up the metaphorical ladder, and as they did, they realized that no paycheck, no amount of stuff, and no prestige could free them of this heavy burden that they somehow could not get rid of. He said that when he grew up, $50,000 was a lot of money, and if he could make that someday, then he would consider himself happy and successful. When he eventually reached that salary, he realized that he felt neither of those things about himself. And that made him wonder how he could change what he did everyday to make sure that he felt like he was doing something that made him both. 

<br><br>
Minimalism, to me, was not about throwing your stuff away or making life choices that made you more eco-friendly and financially-conscious. It redefines the American Dream; it redraws the boundaries of what success means. They talk a lot about how we only get one life; just as with the material items, according to minimalism, everything that we own and do should bring or add value to our lives. How can we ever find value in something that does not bring us joy or happiness, but instead, feels like wasted time? That really stood out to me because the job you have or the money you make or the prestige you gain or the respect you are given will never, ever amount to your own happiness if you do not see it as something that adds value to your life. People talk about how they want to adventure and live and see the world, but instead, they have chased “success” in exchange for giving their aspirations up. 

<br><br>
Minimalism was not a conscious effort to make the world a better place; those are just one of the unintended consequences of the movement. Rather, it was a way to change how you viewed our society; how we can attain happiness and shift our beliefs about what success really is and identify what in life is most important. Even if it does not persuade me to reduce what I have or buy less or view advertisements differently, the documentary did provide me with one takeaway: understand what is important and what is not.

Minimalism is good for society as a whole, however I believe that someone who has the money to afford sufficient food and shelter who is living a minimalistic life would be a lot happier than someone who is scrambling to get food. Coming from a poor family, yes, having more money would cause more problems, but having no money at all literally causes death because they cannot even afford basic necessities. Unless the world works at a whole in order to provide everyone with equitable necessities, I don't believe that this idea of minimalism is effective for everyone. And even if we do consider this minimalistic viewpoint, the materials are already made. We have already created so many things, so where are they going to go? If we begin to live a minimalistic world, we would be throwing the things we have into already overfilled landfills. There are so many statistics and "hopes" for a better world in this video, however how are we going to achieve these hopes? No type of solution is mentioned at all in this video so how are we going to begin this "minimalistic" life?
<br><br><hr><br>
I really liked the part where Joshua and Ryan spoke about their pasts and their broken homes. It really showed the viewer how that part of their lives influenced their outlooks on life and their switch to a minimalist lifestyle. Them describing that part of their life really shows how humble they've remained over all that time, even now that they have become famous and are making way more money than they used to. When Joshua spoke about his 6 year marriage coming to an end the same year he lost his mother, I felt nothing but empathy for him. Shortly after that, he began removing things and people that did not bring any added value to his life. After watching this film, I began thinking about the countless times I spent money on useless things that most likely don't even exist in my life anymore. I could have saved so much money and space on these objects. The 2 guys from The Minimalists encouraged me to question everything I buy now and even begin getting rid of things I don't necessarily need anymore.

To be honest, the video appeals to both my logic and my interests. I mean for the reading this week, Walden’s minimalism has gone too far to be accessible. But for these two young men, minimalism comes with only one point, making modest consumptions instead of purchasing more than needed. I find their point really inspiring. First and most importantly, it saves money and doesn’t take away much happiness. Although human desires are infinite, the first several  purchases are necessary and one is doing the others subconsciously and those purchases are inefficient. The film pinpointed that ads account for most of these ineffective purchases, especially on issues about houses and clothes. Just think about the idea, living happily with fewer costs. Actually I don’t think “happier” is quite true or this word is somewhat misleading in the film. Spending less itself cannot lead to more happiness, and instead, as you spend less, the loose budget and thus lowered working pressure, the money saved for more meaningful stuff can lead to more happiness. 
<br><br>
But after all minimalism has its restraints as it establishes its background as people over consume and are comparatively wealthy, which is quite common in developed countries but not other countries. Therefore, promoting such ideas in countries including the USA can be effective no doubt, but considering this, people in China and India. It is not rare to see 10 people living in houses less than 100 m2. Some people will say, well, it can help the wealthy upper-class in these countries realize their wasting. However, I would say those who are wealthy don’t love this idea. As minimalism leads to unavoidable shrinkage of working hours and purchasing power, the wealthiest level may start to lose tremendous amounts of money, way out of the gain of savings they can have from minimalism. Therefore, in fact, this ideology appeals to middle and middle-upper class. With these classes never wealthy enough to think about this question, minimalism cannot be promoted.

I really agree with you, I think Walden is pretty inaccessible, but a modern minimalist view is appealing and practical... It feels like something I've already naturally gravitated towards, coming from a family that always had a lot more than we needed. And I think it's helpful the way you framed the argument the film makes, it's not less stuff that's the answer to happiness, it's the freedom to focus on what matters most when your brain and space is more manageable and moderate. I think this message is for sure focused on countries that do typically have high consumption and comparative wealth. 
<br><br>

It is interesting to think about how minimalism could be translated for the very wealthy. Could owning big businesses and having big investments still allow for a branch of minimalism that accepts larger investments but minimizes personal expenditures? It would be interesting to see someone try.

I thought the film, Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things or the alternative 
<br><br>
 did a good job in explaining how today’s society became so materialistic. It’s interesting how they pointed out how much advertising and easy access to online shopping has contributed to the staggering amount of things people purchase. The idea of a tiny house could become appealing if it became popular on social media and advertised more, but society has been conditioned to always seek out more. Living a minimalist life seems to lead to less creation of waste yet, minilistics like Joshua Millburn still drive around in a car that emits CO2. Yeah I do think people often buy to try to satisfy their feeling of being unwhole and hope to gain it through products since in advertisements that seems to bring the people some sense of “happiness”, yet in reality it does not. 
 <br><br>
  I think they point out an important idea about how the current fashion industry and advertisements normalize throwing away good clothes not because they worned out, but when they are not fashionable or trendy anymore. In order to get people to accept being satisfied with less they would have to see big well known celebrities choose a more minimalistic life and to see more marketing of it.

I agree that living a minimalist life seems to lead to less waste and CO2 emissions. I agree with your comment about people wanting to buy stuff to feel whole. Everything we’ve been reading and watching this week makes me want to live a more minimalistic lifestyle. I realize I don’t need material goods to be happy, rather just living a basic, simple, stress-free life.
<br><br><hr><br>
In regards to the online shopping point, I think you are absolutely right, in that the convenience of online shopping has made it so popular, and also that the solution to popularizing the minimalist lifestyle would be to make it more accessible or convenient. We live in an era of convenience, in which people look for the quickest solution in which they can see the results of their actions the fastest, whether through online shopping, ordering food/going out to eat, or even through fad dieting.
<br><br> 
Of course we should try to implement this strategy and encourage others to adopt minimalism, but I am doubtful on how effective it will be. Why would people give up their seemingly great lives with great stuff for a cause that they do not believe even exists? It is a preposterous notion, especially as ingrained as the capitalist notion of success is in our modern society, because "what is success if you cannot flaunt it?" is such a common way of thinking. I think that truly the only way to truly encourage minimalism would be to somehow incentivize people to do it, and also easily give everyone the starting tools to begin a minimalist life; I think that if people are given the basic ingredients, the recipe, and an incentive to follow it, the vast majority of them will. Of course this is all a nonsense theoretical argument, but I think that, if widely adopted, minimalism would fix the majority of problems associated with climate change and drastically reduce carbon emissions.
 <br><br>
Despite the positive effect of minimalism on the environment, I am not sure that it would have positive social ramifications. I recently read an article from the Washington Post about Amish communities in Pennsylvania, who lead a minimalist life, and it showed stunning data on how many women in those communities endured sexual assault throughout most of their young lives and at least part of their adult lives. I am not sure if it is a result of the minimalist lifestyle with which they live, or other cultural factors, but I can say that the correlation between the two does concern me greatly, because, while minimalism would help the environment, there are other solutions, and those solutions do not have as steep a cost to half of the population.

The concept of minimalism heavily reminds me of Buddhism because it preaches a letting go of worldly desire as a step to take toward reaching enlightenment. While minimalism doesn't deal with the cycle of life or gods with thirty heads and arms, it has a similar theme of getting rid of things you don't need as a way of reaching happiness. As I watched the transitions of the minimalists from corporate workers to traveling authors, I couldn't help but noticing how their journey was just like those who completely abandon their past lives, giving up all of their possessions, career paths, and even their hair to live at a Buddhist temple and devote their lives to enlightenment. Many do this for the same reasons as the minimalists: they're unhappy with corporate life, where they work everyday for hours to no end. 
<br><br>
Just like Buddhism, I don't think minimalism is for everyone. While I can't deny the environmental benefits to this lifestyle, such as drastically lowering one's carbon footprint, it takes a serious amount of dedication to pull it off. That being said, those who do go through with the commitment and, as a result, become happier, that's great. Unfortunately, its unrealistic to expect the same from everyone else. 

<br><br>
While I don't think minimalist can be applied to everyone, I think there are important takeaways from this minimalist-Buddhist idea of less. Consumer culture in first-world countries is getting out of hand; this damages not only our environment, but also our mindset. Once we have a taste of comfort and the high of buying more, we need more. Unfortunately, our planet might not be able to keep up with our consumption. If we want to change they way we do things, we should start with wanting less.

In the film, Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things, Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields explain how big this issue of consumerism is in our society, and how this arising dissatisfaction of life can lead us to give into the idealized view of “having more = more happiness” truly believing that we can fill the void within ourselves with numerous possessions. They take on the simplicity of living and explain the beauty behind Minimalism, this sense of liberation, breaking free from the chains of corporal brain-washing. They explain how the rising rates of fashion, technology, and this indoctrinating propaganda has led the people to believe that through higher levels of consumption and ownership of more possession comes happiness, when in reality it only brings us discontent and this constant dreadful sensation of desire. The documentary does a good job of bringing to the light these unhealthy habits of consumerism present in our society and how we don’t realize how much of our lives revolves around this idea of “possessions” and “public image”. Their backstory, and motives for their minimalist mindset really helps the audience captivate their changes in perception over time and how they came to be, from reaching and searching for the“American Dream” to realizing the fraudulent and broken system that brainwashes citizens everyday and realizing that true liberation and happiness in the opposite direction, with ironically less possessions. 
<br><br>
 This documentary aims to appeal to the general American public, the average daily consumer. The film analyzes the average american family, and household to help the comprehend why people set the goals they have or spend and consume the way they do. They have exposed these falsified ideals that make the average person believe that if they own more, they will be more content with themselves, when in reality the film emphasizes and assentates the main idea that “Money cannot buy happiness”. The true American dream lies within personal peace and content with one's lifestyle, but society has embedded this idea that happiness can be obtained through this absurd level of consumption; this destructive desire of wanting to have the new Iphone, or wanting to own a new flashy car. This film made me realize how common this falsified image of happiness in our modern society and how brain-washed we are as a public. It made me think of the true destructive yet persuasive forces that enact on our minds every day of our lives through passive images, commercials, billboards, and much more. It made me realize that I myself have fallen victim to this consumerist mindset. 
<br><br>

 Ryan and Joshua show us the more than satisfactory lifestyle they lead, with such little possession, only utilizing what they need. They show us how materialistic we are in the complete sense of the word. They show us how Minimalism can liberate us from these societal restraints, how it can lead us to true inner peace and happiness. They expose how constricting consumerism is and how it doesn’t let us truly become who we can become because no matter how much clothes we buy or how much we indulge in luxury we will never suffice our inner hunger for pleasure or feeling whole. 
<br><br>

 One of my favorite parts of the film was the interview with Colin Wright and his realization of what would make him truly happy. I find it intriguing and how he interprets failure in the sense that since he was a very successful man, but since he wasn’t doing what he really wanted to do (to travel the world) so in his mind no matter the riches he possessed it still would bring him happiness until he gave into what he felt would would bring him happiness. And to me this true pursuit of happiness is the purpose of life. 
<br><br>

 The film brings me to the conclusion, that the true happiness lies within our hearts and mind, and not in the clothes we wear, or the car we drive, or chains we lace around our neck. Minimalism has opened up my mind to this new form of living, making me realize that maybe we don’t need to completely drop our lives, but we do need to stop consuming so much, because in the end it won’t bring us happiness.

I agree that the more we consume, the more we will believe that our happiness lies in and depends on the materials we consume, therefore we will never be satisfied with what we have now and will always long for what we do not and cannot have. On the opposite, if we abandon the consumerist mindset, we will find that we should not gain happiness by obtaining stuff, but should discover it within ourselves. Another scene in the movie where they mentioned that the more you consume, the less you are satisfied reminded me of my economics class lecture. The professor taught us the utility theory: the marginal utility rate of a product will be decreasing, meaning that you get 10 points of satisfaction when you buy the first one of a product, for example a clothes, but 8 when you buy the second, and less and less satisfaction every time you buy one more unit of that product until it approaches to zero utility. This is a perfect demonstration of what Ryan and Joshua are trying to explain and lead people into thinking. 
<br><br>


When I was starting off with the movie, I was watching the interviewee talking about her experience switching her location of residence from a city community to a suburban farming area with houses built by her own. I was very confused because I remember professor Hiltner talked about several advice of actions to reduce carbon emission, including moving to a city or co-housing area because all the resources like public transportation are rather centralized so efficiency can be achieved. But later in the movie I came to the realization that minimalism is not a certain location of living, or a certain way of arranging the interior area of your home, or a certain combination of ingredients of your diet, it is rather a lifestyle and more importantly the mindset you make up to live that lifestyle. And minimalism is not about throwing all your stuff away either, your books, your pet, your furniture, but rather it is about keeping all the things that really matter to you after figuring out which.
<br><br>

After watching the movie I feel that minimalism should be promoted with more effort because it is not only an effective method to reduce carbon release but it is a great life philosophy to debunk the morbid consumerism culture.

The first time I heard about minimalism was through the reading of this week. I was curious about the lifestyle, but if I were to be honest, I did not know if I could do it because I thought that it was too big of a change of lifestyle. This documentary changed my thinking. After seeing people of different backgrounds able to go from their former lifestyle to one of minimalism, it gives me hope that I can do that too. After seeing how much happier they are in their minimalist lifestyle compared to their old one, I truly believe that this is the better way to live. It also helps that minimalism could help with our climate crisis as living a minimalist lifestyle, like Ken said, can have a significant environmental impact.
<br><br>
In order to have a significant environmental impact however, we essentially must 'maximize' minimalism, which is basically having enough people to change our the structure of our current society and economy. If I were to be honest, I would say it would be very challenging to do that, nearing impossible. The past generation has lived and built the materialistic society to how it is today, and our current generation is being raised in said materialistic society. Many people will have doubts like me, and many people will simply be too lazy to consider going against what our society values. Even though I think there is a low chance to maximize minimalism, I will do my part by trying to incorporate minimalist values in my lifestyle now.

Although I would find a minimalist lifestyle challenging I must admit that those minimalist floor plans were very intriguing. The thought of how everything worked for many different purposes such as sleeping, dining, having guests, working was something that I truly believe is the future that we are heading towards. Although many people will disagree with that method of living it is a great way of reducing your carbon footprint. 
<br><br>
 I must admit that I have a problem with getting rid of my materials, even though I don’t wear them but after watching this film the philosophy of “Does this add value to my life?” will definitely be put into consideration.

We live in a society where it is believed that happiness can be “bought” through the accumulation of stuff. Through the ads that are aired on television to the magazines in doctor’s offices to social media apps on our phones, we are constantly reinforced with the notion that you need this product because it will enhance your life and make it better. Not only through the ads, but it has been brainwashed into our heads that our success and happiness are dependent on having big mansions or houses, having multiple cars, and making sure that they’re full of stuff. Lots of stuff. Due to this consumer culture of constantly making purchases, we are not getting any happier and are only continuing to give money to huge corporations.
<br><br>
I had watched the Minimalist document previously and I 100% agree that this is a lifestyle that everyone should switch to. Personally, I have not made this adjustment since I continuously shop online on Amazon to buy books or order items that I am only going to use once, but it is something I want to do. I have never been a person who cared about having stuff until I felt like everyone else had a particular item, which made me feel left out. I am guessing this is probably a strategy that ads use to get people to buy items because they do not want to feel like they’re the only ones without them. With this minimalist lifestyle, you only have what you need and you’re not buying new items simply because of feeling left out. This way of life would definitely cut down on consumer consumption because you’re only buying what you need. 
<br><br>

The New Dream’s idea of a Plenitude Economy sounds very promising because not only does it address the needs for a more viable planet, but it accounts for human well-being. Switching to this economy would mean doing practices that ensure that we are taking care of our planet and putting its needs first. People would grow their own food in their homes and result in DIY and making their own items through the practices of recycling and reusing items. I thought the house in the video looked so beautiful and gave me an idea of what my future home will look like. It also accounts for people because it would mean less work during the week, giving them more time to spend time with friends and family and doing all of the things they love. It would give people the chance to live life more because they’re constantly at work and doing more than capacity. I feel as if the Green New Deal and this Plenitude Economy could merge into one system because they both have ideals that are geared towards the interests of the environment and resulting in changing our current economic system.

I agree with you very much. I think minimalism doesn't have to be a very extreme life, or it's too extreme.

Minimalism doesn't mean that you lose a lot of things or live with just a few things (you may see others do it)
<br><br>
But in fact, they know more about themselves and know how to keep what they really need.
<br><br>

I like the following sentence:
<br><br>

Minimalism is not about what you lose or what you subtract, it's about creating more. More time, more energy, more enthusiasm.
<br><br>

I think everyone should at least have some knowledge of minimalism and learn to apply it to our lives. Because it's just as important as learning how to manage money. There may be little or no way to teach you how to manage money correctly in school, but it's a skill that every one of us must understand in life.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree we live in a society that believes happiness can be “brought” because of the brief feeling of satisfaction that comes with buying and owning new things. Advertisements are everywhere now, especially on social media. Influencers on Instagram and Youtube are promoting consumerism in almost every video and post. They are sponsored by many companies and these people have thousands and sometimes even millions of followers. I remember watching the Minimalist documentary and thinking how amazing living that lifestyle would be; how almost stress-free it looks. I cannot cut off so many things at once but I began to shop less on clothes and shoes because I realized how wasteful I was being. 
<br><br>
I think it is really hard to cut out so many things in today’s society, but definitely not impossible. I think all that is required to live a minimalist lifestyle is dedication to it. But it does seem like only a few can actually accomplish this, at least in the United States. As you mentioned, some people buy things to not feel left out and that is true. I think apple phones and computers are a perfect example of that. Maybe if the Minimalist documentary was shown in schools it could put the idea into people’s minds early on before their wants and needs to buy things begin.

<br><br><hr><br>
I believe that one of the reasons that our consumerist attitude is so deeply ingrained into our way of living and perceiving the world is because we were taught that this is how we are supposed to live from a very young age. Looking around almost any public area, buildings are covered with advertisements attempting to sell us things. On the television, commercials pop up encouraging us to purchase new products, and now that new forms of media consumption have become easier through the power of the internet and modern technology, companies use the power of advertising to permanently sear in the idea that our purpose in society is to be consumers.

This process is only beginning to start earlier and earlier. Many kids in elementary school have technological devices such as iPhones that have complete unrestrained access to the internet. While this is dangerous for many reasons, I believe that it poses a special threat in the form of allowing advertisers to target children. Children have always been the dream audience for sellers because they are so easily persuaded and less significant things appear more exciting to them. When adults watch advertisements, even for products or appliances they need, they tend to be more hesitant and less willing to buy things on a whim. However, kids have such a strong desire to have new objects to play with. This leads to them asking their parents to buy them new things all the time. While this doesn't seem like a particularly harmful practice, it reinforces the idea that living in our society is deeply connected to ownership and consumption. To live a truly minimalistic lifestyle, one would need to be raised in a condition where deprivation from the many seemingly positive parts of our consumeristic culture still feels possible and safe.

When I started to be interested in minimalist life and zero garbage life, there were many contradictions and doubts. What bothers me the most is "Is the cost of the twisting effort for the so-called environmental protection and zero garbage lock really low? "The cost of normal living" "It takes more time and effort to achieve true zero waste, what's the point?"
<br><br>
I continue to experience and think about the former. For example, the production of wood products does not need to be environmentally friendly. The deliberate pursuit of steel, wood, glass, and cloth is not necessarily environmentally friendly. It is meaningless to classify waste under the existing regulations, but at least we can use our own methods to Contributing to environmental protection. Although it can't be completely minimal, it can make life simple. For example, replace the disposable lunch box with an existing lunch box, collect plastic bags and gift bags for multiple uses. Reject excess plastic bags provided by the merchant when shopping.
<br><br>
The second question is my current understanding: if you do n’t change it from now on, it will never change. I ca n’t make zero garbage, but I do my best to reduce the negative impact on the environment. It can subtly drive people around to throw away one plastic bag and bring tableware to eat. Great start. Moreover, environmental protection and a minimalist lifestyle make me more relaxed and comfortable. Compared with the past, I can better restrain my inflated material desires and think about the relationship between me and nature.

From watching the documentary, "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," the message that stuck out to me, is that we continue to purchase things in life because we believe they bring us joy and satisfaction. When something trends and is being advertised, we assume that we need that clothing item or electronic device because it will make us feel "complete." While watching this video, I asked myself if I really feel fulfilled when I continue to shop and catch up with trends. In part yes, I do feel happy getting to engage in that. Yet, while watching this film, I thought about the things that I truly value in my life and how they do not always involve online shopping and having the best phone. Apart from thinking this, I also reflected on the impact that we have left on our planet due to our choices that involve shopping and wanting a "perfect lifestyle."
<br><br>
Moreover, in watching this film, I had no idea about people choosing a minimalist lifestyle. I learned a lot, in seeing people change their life by giving away their belongings and living a simple life. Minimalism completely contradicts the luxurious life that someone dreams of, a life that we think of from the start. It is important to acknowledge that many people from all over the world won't dream of a simple life nor choose to have it, but rather want a more wealthy and developed one.

I completely agree that watching this documentary made me reevaluate all of the consumerist choices that I have made due to what the fashion industry and society has told me to do.  I found that while it has made me happy in the moment to look like everyone else, I often get overwhelmed by the clutter and end up losing it in the back of my closet when the trend has ceased.  What I found very interesting that relates to what you said about it making you happy but it not in the grand scheme of life, is when the minimalist men talked to getting rid of stuff that brings you joy.  He talked about a man who was sad to not be living a minimalist lifestyle because of his love for his books and not wanting to give them up because of the joy it brings to him and others.  What his response was is that you do not need to get rid of the things that bring you happiness, you need to get rid of the things that are cluttering up your life.  So many people are taking the initiative to lead a more fulfilling and successful life, not in a monetary sense, but in a way that you are choosing what you buy or get rid of deliberately.  It makes you more present, less stressed, and all-together happier, and that is why I loved this documentary so much.  It was not preaching for everyone to be minimalists in the most extreme sense of the world, but doing things that make you happy instead of just doing them because society tells you it will make you trendy or fulfilled.  It was an inspiring piece that I am glad I got to watch and I walked away from it motivated to declutter my life.

After watching "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," I realized the extent to which I participate in consumer culture. I found that, much like you stated, I enjoy participating in trends to a certain extent. It has become increasingly harder not to conform to the new trends of fast fashion, new technologies, and lavish lifestyles. Through targeted ads and social media, it is all too easy to tell what the latest trends are and how/ where you can buy the things that allow you to participate. 
<br><br> 
Take airpods for example. Despite having two different types of bluetooth headphones already, I was still the first in line, along with many others, to buy a new set of airpods that had been advertised by not only Apple, but also by many of my classmates who were free walking advertisements. This is the biggest problem within consumer culture; we see something we want, then we get it. It is a very hard lifestyle to change, but the film shows all the positive effects this change could make. Hopefully I can retain the willpower this class is giving me and continue to make these adjustments to my current lifestyle.
  <br><br><hr><br>

  I like that your bring up the idea of being "complete" from the video because something that is brought up early in Minimalism is how many younger people seek for things in advertisements or shown by their idols, as a means of becoming "complete." The comparison is that we not being forced but rather pushed into thinking this way without knowing. Being nudged little by little through this constant stream of stimuli makes it difficult for many to distinguish what I truly want and I am being pushed into wanting. The story that Joshua Fields Millburn & Ryan Nicodemus talk about when they introduce their parents and how their parents felt trapped is how many people feel right now. They want this stuff but they cant afford it, or even if they buy it there is no satisfaction from receiving it. It's like a constant loop of dissatisfaction because people are looking for answers outside themselves when often they should look within. Ask yourself "why do i want this" or "will this improve my life" and often more than not, you can find the answer without much thinking outside your own brain. If Minimalism could be summarized, it could be described as "less is more." The less you use and have, the more meaning you can make out of the stuff you got because most of it is the stuff that matters.

The films before this one made it really easy for me to agree with them, but "Minimalism" was completely different. While watching the documentary, I found that I too had to think about myself and how I contribute and engage with this type of consumption. It was honestly very hard; I like buying stuff and before watching this video, I could have never contemplated trying out a minimalist lifestyle. However, this film really opened my eyes and let me see how some of the things I find completely normal should not be. For example, they talked about the advertisements targeting children. As a young child, I liked watching tv and those type of commercials would be on all the time. I never really stopped to think how that might not be the best thing for young, impressionable children.

You mention the fact that we buy things with the belief that they will bring us joy. This reminded me of how just last week, I was lamenting the fact that I can't afford a new phone AND a new laptop. Of course, both of these items serve their purposes quite adequately. But the ads are everywhere. Newer versions are in the hands of everyone I know. There is a sort of pressure to have the newest thing, not just because I want it, but because everyone else wants it. Buying new things is part of how we fit into this society.

<br><br>
I remember how I felt when I first opened the box of my current phone: a sense of giddy elation that, while memorable, was ultimately fleeting. Part of me wants that feeling again, and yet, another part of me is conscious of the high price I would have to pay for it. I am somewhat thankful for that high price, because it keeps me from making rash decisions with regards to buying electronics that I would otherwise have no second thoughts about buying. The thing is, eventually we are forced to buy the new phone and the new laptop because all the software we need to use won't run on the old hardware. This is not just computer games, but software that we need to use for work as well. People are too dependent on these devices to just stop buying them en masse, and the companies producing these products have us backed into a corner. While I agree that our lives would probably be better without this rapid consumer culture we have developed over the past several decades, I am at a loss as to how to fix it.
   <br><br><hr><br>
   I completely agree with you in saying that many consume more than they should because of joy or satisfaction. I myself have been a participant of retail therapy. The whole time I was watching this film I kept agreeing with everything that was being said and strongly agree that minimalism could be a solution to this hyperconsumerism. However, as a consumer, many do not really think about how it all impacts the planet, I know I didn’t for the first 18 years of my life. This idea of buying less, owning less, being as minimalistic as possible goes against social beliefs in the US: of the American Dream, that because one works hard, they can buy and have what they want. Although I believe Minimalism is better for us AND the planet, I am not sure if we could all re-invert our culture so drastically. Nevertheless, as put in the film I believe there could be an agreement for individuals to consume less rather than becoming hard-core minimalists. It would take more economic and social influences on the public to get anywhere near this goal. As the climate crisis becomes more prudent, this American Dream needs to change as well to living off of the thing we need, not what we particularly WANT.

As someone who enjoys shopping, I see the damage that being materialist can do. Being materialist often supports fast fashion, which is quickly destroying the environment. Living in a consumer society, it can be from pressure or the need to buy things to make yourself happy that pushes this continuous cycle. But it is also important to know who can or can't be a materialist, just as it’s important to note that living a minimalist lifestyle might not be a choice that someone can make, but the only option that is available to them. Someone who participates in a minimalist lifestyle might choose to live in a smaller home or apartment, something such as the micro-apartments that were discussed in lecture, which can be around 250 square feet. However, some people have no other option but to live in such a small living space, perhaps with family, because they cannot afford anything else. When discussing sustainable change, it is important to consider that it's not a change that can be made by everyone or is not an affordable option. 
<br><br>
That being said, I believe living a minimalist lifestyle can be a viable option and definitely create a meaningful impact. As was noted before,  by choosing to live a minimalist lifestyle, you are using and purchasing only what is necessary. You are not going out of your way to buy more than you need and in turn are furthering yourself from participating in harmful acts. By choosing a minimalist lifestyle, you will not purchase more clothing items that necessary and will therefore, not participate in fast fashion. Additionally if you are living a minimalist lifestyle, you aren't going to be wasting food by purchasing more than necessary or throwing out food that could still be perfectly fine to eat.

I completely agree with you in the sense of acknowledging that living a minimalist lifestyle is not a choice everyone can make that easily. It is important to acknowledge the privilege that comes with being able to be minimalist for those that have the funds and ability to do so. Some people struggle to even meet the standard of having enough. With that being said, I do appreciate some of the content in the documentary. I appreciate that there was a sense of personal stories incorporated throughout the documentary with Joshua, Ryan and other interviewees. Joshua shared how working so much for bigger checks caused him to not have enough time for his mom, and he felt guilty when she passed away. Another was the interviewee who stated he felt trapped when he got promoted and didn't really want that life even though it was making him a lot of money. As a person who has lived low-income my whole life, and has seen my parents struggle so much financially, it is bizarre to me to here people say that them making a good amount of money is a trap. 
<br><br>
I do really like the comment one of the interviewees mentioned about finding that balance, and having enough. I think that a lot of people who are rich and live big need to hear that especially considering they do impact the environment  heavily. I also found it so infuriating the way that fast fashion has 52 seasons as you mentioned and there is always that need for the "new stuff". The worst part of consumerism as well is the $17 billion that is spent on being able to sell to children which is absolutely disturbing. The toys are also very gender constructed, and like the interviewee said, there is no positive to selling to kids at all.
<br><br><hr><br>
I believe minimalism is definitely a viable option for living. As Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields talk about in the entire movie we shouldn't just chase what we "think" will make us happy. We should find what makes us happy. One thing I do disagree on however, is that throughout the movie they made it seem like you couldn't be happy with things. It may seem shallow but there are plenty of people in this world who are happy with more things. They obviously should find sustainable ways to live the maximalist life. 
<br><br>
As you said there are many people in the world who don't have a choice in living a minimal life. These people cannot afford to be materialist. And once these people are able to buy things they honestly should be able to do what makes them happy at the end of the day. 
<br><br>
Personally, living a minimalist life seems like the best option to combat issues such as fast fashion. From previous documentaries we already know the negative impact fast fashion has on our environment, and if more people wanted or bought less "things" less "things" would be manufactured. As the different parents with kids were saying towards the end of the documentary I understand that you can not force a minimalist lifestyle on kids, however you can teach them early on that toys and games will not be their sole source of joy.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really appreciate your comment for it's humility. I think as people raised with the doctrine of bigger is better and more is best in the American dream propaganda, it's very difficult for us not to engage in this absurd rat race. I agree that a minimalist lifestyle can be a viable option for many who are sucked into the constant swirl of consumerism. However, much like they say in the documentary, some people will not adopt the full boar minimalist lifestyle. And very much like a plant based diet, there are steps that can be taken. Moving to a tiny home and giving up 75% of all someone's stuff may not be something that everyone has the gumption to adopt. And that should be ok. But I am of the mind that those who can and are willing should and those who can't should do what they can and those who lack willingness should do what they are willing to do. 
<br><br>
I again would like to acknowledge the humility that must be taken when making changes like this in recognizing one's own failings.

The Minimalists are like the white hipster versions of Marie Kondo. I spent the whole documentary imagining leaving behind their old items and contemplating, “Does this spark joy in my life?” The answer for so many items in our own lives is usually no. We live in a culture that applauds excess and encourages consumerism. It’s so easy to accept this as our reality and feel obligated to follow along. However, as so many people in this documentary describe, one just needs to see that there is an option, that there is an alternative to living in constant consumerism. Pursuing a minimalist lifestyle provides so much opportunity for choice and freedom. In a country where we live to work, we need to learn to work to live.
<br><br>
 At one point watching this I did consider why we were watching it for this class about the climate crisis. I understood that decreasing consumerism would cause a massive decline in the amount of production, transportation, and other industrial practices, resulting in a society that pollutes less. Putting an end to fast fashion especially would decrease our large amount of material waste. But I don’t remember environmentalism ever being mentioned as a reason for minimalism in the documentary. This film shows that there are so many other benefits of being environmentally conscious beyond helping our planet. Environmentally conscious lifestyles, including minimalism, have great impacts on your personal happiness and mental health.

I like your use of the question, "Does this spark joy in my life?", and the connection to Marie Kondo.  I had not heard of her until your comment, but I did some research and am more interested to hear what she has to say.  I also think this question is what is at the heart of advertising.  In the film it states that companies spent $17 billion dollars advertising to children in 2006.  We live in an attention economy where companies are trying to get out attention so that we think that their product sparks joy, or will spark joy in our lives.  I always wonder if advertising really works on adults because I do not think I have ever bought anything due to an advertisement alone, but then again it would be hard for me to know. 

<br><br>
This is another example of how climate change is more of a cultural issue than a scientific one.  Advertising and Things are so intertwined with modern American society, there is likely no turning back.  Even in my life I know that I would never live an entirely minimalist life even though it would be good for the environment, and as you said in your comment, good for many other aspects of my life.  I just have an idea of what a good life is, and I doubt that I can fully rewire my thinking to change that, especially with society backing up my current mindset.  I think this is a major theme for me and many others when it comes to climate change.  While I want to help the environment through my choices, and I do a little bit, I don't think I could ever stop driving, stop eating meat, and throw away all my clothes and live in a small house.  Unless there is a major cultural shift towards environmentalism, I doubt any real change will occur.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also immediately thought of Marie Kondo and the idea of objects "sparking joy", and began to question myself and the things in my room after watching "Minimalism". I was thoroughly inspired by Colin Wright and his possession of only 51 items in total. This gave me some perspective and reminded me that we honestly do not need much to live a content, fruitful life; yet it is our consumption-centered society that has pushed the United States and other developed countries to live the way we are living. It is clear that this capitalistic society does not bring true joy to people, and while the cycle of buying, feeling happy, feeling sad, and then buying again can be broken, it definitely is not easy for most Americans. 
<br><br>
I also feel that fast fashion is a major part of the wasteful society that we live in. A ridiculous amount of energy, labor, and material goes into making cheap and trendy clothing that will quickly end up in a landfill and overall be a waste. To me, buying sturdier and more sustainable clothing is one of the simplest ways to reduce waste and eventually realize that someone does not need much to lead a successful life, and swearing off fast fashion heavily decreases one's consumption.

I think "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" did a good job at "curbing the appetite for more things." There were quite a few parts of the film that were shocking. I. think I was most shocked by the scene at 30:51 of the film. I am contemplating on whether or not that might have been scripted. If it was not then that is just scary. The lady even took a box from a little kid. Another part of the film that stood out to me was the part towards the end in which they are discussing advertisements aimed at children. I have looked after a good amount of kids, and many of them watch tv while playing. (They most likely always watch a channel that plays kid shows 24/7.) I think EVERY SINGLE commercial that passes on one of the channels is an advertisement for a toy or food just how they mentioned. Honestly, I think it's just those two back to back. A lot of the toys are so unnecessary, I think I have even seen some that have made me question whether or not the advertisement was real or not.

I agree with you that the film is very well put together; there is enough shock value in these different scenes, and yet they're not superficial or clickbait-y in anyway, but rather is very real. Unfortunately, I don't think the scene that you mentioned is scripted, which is scary, because it really makes you stop and think about what we as a collective have come to. Are material things and acquiring them at a "good deal" so important to us that we stoop down to such a low level in treating another human being with what can only be described as very animalistic behavior as shown in the film.
<br><br>
The part that really made me sick was the extent that retailers go to to make sure they sell as much stuff as possible and as fast as possible. Not only do they come out with dozens of designs each week and manipulate consumers into thinking they need new clothes to stay trendy, they destroy their unsold clothes, "slashing them with scissors" so that no one else and use or resell those clothes. 
<br><br>
I also agree with you that a lot of the things advertised to children out there are rather questionable, not only toys, as mentioned in the film, but also entertainment/content, especially on youtube. There are so many channels on youtube targeting children, with adults dressing up as Elsa or Spiderman and acting out skits with plot lines that are absolutely disturbing and disgusting. It's even more concerning that in this day and age, people are always hustling and trying to make more money, which means parents don't have the time to filter out everything that their kids consume, so I'm glad that recently there has been stricter policies around advertisements aimed at children. But we still have a long way to go.
<br><br><hr><br>

While I understand that making commercials going right passed the parents and directly aiming them at kids makes for a successful business, it almost makes me sad that they are brainwashed so heavily and so early to WANT. They want almost everything they see on the commercials in between and honestly, I can't blame them- I was the same growing up. It just saddens me to think that this consumer culture is cultivated at such a young age. This consumer way of life can lead a child into a greedy future encouraging constant buying or unnecessary items. I am upset with the media for taking advantage of the brains of little kids who don't know any better and want to have the next best thing from Toys R Us.

The Minimalist upholds the ideology that humanity has voluntarily subjected itself to live miserable lives in the sense that they will never reach contentment and satisfaction with what they have. As the film depicts the concept, it centers its focus on the materialistic society of the United States. The US, as one of the wealthiest nations in the world, has earned itself the connotation as being a country with large stuff such as large shopping malls, food portions, and bank accounts. Therefore people have learned to associate the concept of there being a lot of stuff to them having to own a lot of stuff and most of the time these things are necessary and luxury items that cost a few hundred if not a few thousand dollars. Even to this day, I cannot completely wrap my head around the exact reason for why people would spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a sweatshirt that has the Balenciaga logo. However, it is understandable that people buy the sweatshirt (in this case) because they like the design but to some degree, I believe that everyone who is willing to spend that amount of money on a single item doesn’t only purchase it to improve their fashion style but rather to impress those around them. This mentality continues when buying cars, and homes. People buy Ferraris and mansions because they want to impress those around them because in the US the indicator of success is the size of your home and the number of luxury goods you own. Therefore our society has become fixated on materialism. For that reason, the message of the minimalist of living happily with less is not so popular because people have grown and learned to associate wealth and success with stuff thus anything other than this is abnormal and foreign. Due to the fact that our society is rooted in the concept of materialism, I don't believe that the first class will ever stop from buying more because otherwise how would the socioeconomic status which society labels each individual be noticeable at first glance.

This is the second time that I started watching Minimalism, but the first time that I finished it. The first time I knew this film was during my religion class in high school. I looked at the beginning part, and decided to sleep. When Joshua talked about the idea of Minimalism, I thought it was absurd. I believed he thought the life of minimalism is happy because he experienced a luxurious life. When he is tired with his fantasy life, and the idea of minimalism comes to his mind, he will definitely give up his luxury life, and turn to minimalism. But most people didn’t experience luxury life, so how can they give up their life and turn to minimalism? You are just denying their efforts of creating a better life. 
<br><br>
However, after I took ENGL 23, I had a new view of this film. I started to treat it as a new film without any prejudice. And then, I found out minimalism is the right way of living. I’ve seen a comment under the reading section that she said American people live as “minimalism” in 1850s. So what changed their lifestyle? The technology, the advertising. There are so many people good at advertising that they can change your mind easily even if you don’t need that item. Look at my table, I have 20 lipsticks, but there are only three lipsticks that I used commonly. I have 16 makeup brushes, and only 5 of them are used commonly. Many items in my room are the same as my lipsticks and brushes. What caused this phenomenon? My addiction, my desire of shopping. Nowadays, we can receive information easily. I can know which brand has a new product, which website has a discount. All the information leads me to shopping. However, most products I don’t actually need, or I already have a similar one. As the film said, when you actually think about your stuff, you actually need little.

I would like to start by saying Ido agree with your initial point. I found the concept of minimalism hard to fully understand and consider. Of course someone who has had a luxurious life with money and success can make a conscious decisions to alter their habits and live minimalist. However for someone who struggles to pay bills and live normally, it is difficult to give up the little that they do have. 
<br><br>
I was skeptical going into the film as I believed this idea was flawed and had no logical application for most people. I can confidently say, my suspicions were wrong. I was actually interested to learn more about minimalism and peoples personal stories regarding it. I myself began to analyze what I owned. I have far too many items and just junk that I really have no use for. I have far too many shirts and clothing, hair products and so much more. I really don't have much use for half of this stuff. I really related to what you said about simple things like discounts or ads that are prioritized towards getting us to buy more stuff. I fall to these tactics and end up buying way more than I need just because it is new or better priced that the original. I think it is important to consider what minimalism has to offer. I myself could benefit from even working on buying less and getting rid of things I do not ever use pr need anymore.

As the professor has stated, Minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem. The idea of minimalism is fundamentally rooted in Thoreau’s transcendentalism, which emphasizes on individual escapism. By understanding the roots of minimalism, it was no surprise when Joshua said, “minimalism isn’t a radical lifestyle.” It isn’t, rather the lifestyle just happens to be rooted in the core value of not owning lots of things. One thing that stuck with me was a question that a man asked the minimalists, which alluded to using their power to fight what is the actual problem; the rich and the exploitment of the poor. He thought the minimalists were also on the same page of destroying those “wolves of Wall Street,” but instead they responded by saying that they are somewhere in the middle because they are still “consumers but not compulsive consumers.” Therefore, minimalism is fundamentally a personal choice and it does not extend beyond that. Minimalism won’t solve the problems in society; it may provide for form of escapism from the bustle of life and exploitation that is still going on in life, but it is too individualist oriented to fundamentally challenge corporate power and capitalism.
<br><br>
In the beginning of the film, it kept on being mentioned that people have become these giant consumers,  have a gaping void that constantly needs to be filled, but they said that they have not yet found that problem and we are still searching for it. However, I would like to propose that the problem is capitalism which has long been dependent on the alienation of the individual. Thus, we should not looking at minimalist individual change, but rather an institutional change. I think it was good that the professor mentioned a plenitude economy that could be supplemented with minimalism. While that does bring less reliance on the market, it nonetheless would not get rid of capitalism itself, which survives off of mass production. I would like to know how the proposed plentitude economy would work in terms of capitalism? The professor mentioned a nordic country as an example, which is still capitalist (though announced as socialist) since it shifts labour production overseas. Would a plenitude economy be environmentally sustainable in ALL parts of the world, because once again the professor mentioned that Minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem, and third world problems as an effect of first world actions do definitely exist.

I had the same questions about whether mass minimalism would be a viable reality and how that would manifest economically. As much as I support individual minimalism and completely agree with the positive personal emotional and mental effects it can have, I had a hard time imagining how our capitalist societies could function without the powerful force of purchasing power. Not to say I don't support institutional change for a system that doesn't run on rampant inequality and production, but the fact of the matter is that we currently do. And our country and all of its functions depend on Americans buying stuff. So I was very interested as well to learn about plenitude economy, which is a potential solution to unhappiness in individuals, capitalism as a non-sustainable economic system of greed, and the climate crisis. What I found made my pragmatic self very hopeful, and it made a lot of sense. By hiring more employees, unemployment is reduced. As more employees enter the workforce, average work hours decrease. Yes, this means each individual is perhaps earning and working less, but it also decreases inequality. The decrease in income is counteracted by an increase in time and freedom. Not only is this a positive relationally and individually, as people can spend more time at home with loved ones and exercising more agency over how to spend their hours, but it also makes sense. People can devote those extra hours to making sustainable lifestyle choices that would otherwise be difficult to do without the time: like grow their own food, build eco-friendly housing, bike and take public transport to places, feel more fulfilled so that they don't revert to feeding their unhappiness with buying more stuff. This approach also minimizes the amount of services the government may have to provide for its citizens, which is the counterweight of any decreases in purchasing power or manufacturing. But does this really work? I would really hope it does, and I was excited to hear that this type of economy is being used in countries like Sweden. However, I don't know if this type of economy would work in America, which is significantly bigger and different in many highly-important ways: politically, culturally, geographically, etc.

Thank you for your response! I also think that the idea of everyone adopting a minimalist lifestyle is great. It is just hard to see it work on a larger scale beyond the individual’s own choice. I do agree that it would be difficult for all people to adopt minimalism due to the power of global capitalism; it manifests throughout the globe and its impact is everywhere, whether we like it or not. I also wonder if a plenitude economy would be able to work while a capitalist one is also existing and expanding, after all capitalism works as an ever expanding power, engulfing those that it can due to its very nature. 
<br><br>
I also do think that a plenitude economy would seem viable. I looked it up after this video and also found that it would help workers and individuals by reducing working hours, giving better wages, and essentially not focusing as much on a market driven economy. This will definitely benefit individuals and I wonder if it would also benefit society as a whole. I think it will actually help those people who want to adopt a minimalist lifestyle, as they are not as bombarded with work and payments. It is actually very contradictory to hear about the U.S. being a free nation, when in reality, many people spend most of their time working, and paying off things. This contrasts greatly with countries who have adopted a plenitude economy.
 <br><br>
 Like you, I also wonder the extent to which this plenitude economy would work. Would it work only within the nation since only the nation is adopting the plenitude economy? How would nations with plenitude economies treat those who do not have a plenitude economy? I’m particularly thinking about rich nations with much power. Would they exploit the labour of poorer nations in order to feed the plenitude economy of the richer nation?

When watching the documentary, I was trying to predict what would happen next. I thought that “the gaping void” at around 2 minutes was going to be filled with drugs, not stuff. I find it amusing that stuff and drugs could be exchangeable. Two minutes later, addiction is mentioned.
<br><br>
I’ve grown up around people who like to shop. I don’t like to shop, except maybe for food. Someone once told me that their mother doesn’t know how to enjoy anything but shopping, and that’s all she can do. Consumer culture feels so invisible to me, but it’s scary being reminded that it can shape and ruin lives.
<br><br>
I wasn’t surprised at how pretty and fashionable the minimalist houses were. I could tell based on who is making the film that they were going to make minimalism appealing. I really admired those cute living spaces, but I also felt a bit disappointed because I’d never be able to achieve anything as fashionable as that without a lot of money and help. People who don’t have money don’t have the option to buy, but minimalism is also a choice for wealthy people. The movie was a reminder that minimalism is a choice, but also varies based on the individual. I really liked how they showed the family with children that were living a minimalistic lifestyle because it shows how minimalism is different for everyone. It might be harder if you have children, but even some children can accept it. If children can accept it, then adults should also be able to accept minimalism, but life doesn’t work that way. Habits can make or break a person, and most adults are stuck with the same habits, and can be blinded by their habits. This documentary reminds people that the upwards mobility or consumer culture lifestyle are choices, and that you can choose to climb in a different direction.

I agree with you I think that the individuals that choose to live in the minimalist lifestyle in the movie are wealthy enough to afford making this change and live in an aesthetically pleasing household. The movie makes this lifestyle seem like a privilege, these people are willingly living minimal lives when people in poverty are being forced to live minimally. I think if we were to make a change as Americans to live more green, living minimally doesn't appeal to many Americans, as most are already caught up in the consumer culture that consumes us all.

In the film, “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy '', it emphasizes the importance of  making a plenitude economy and giving possible solutions on ways to become this successful economy. In the video, it enhances how it would be better to reduce the job hours, so that people will be healthier and there wouldn't be any greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. It was interesting how the video distinguishes that more labor hours reduces the health of people and makes them more depressed. With less hours, it would lead to people purchasing less items and making the companies go bad in the business world. People lose eyes on the pursuit of happiness since they are always focusing on more hours for the money to get more items. This opens my eyes to see how there is more to life than materialistic things and it doesn't matter how many hours you work but how you invest your money. I really enjoyed how the film was straight into the point with enough detail to describe and explain what is going to happen into the 21 century. In addition, the film distinguishes how the prices will continue to increase since the labor increases and making it harder for the compani

es to pay them. This will continue to make the economy go down.Because we constantly invest our time in our occupations ,we loose track of time and become less happy with our life. We have less time for ourselves since the work hours increase and the overwhelming work load. We need to stop focusing on money because money can't buy us long-lasting happiness. We should be happy on how we live our lives not what we buy for it.

The two short films on consumerism are inspiring. The widely known “American dream” is basically a promotion of material wealth and excess luxury. In other words, it's the trend of big houses and fancy cars. Ironically, this pursuit of opulence is even more so in my home country. Think about it, how many countries could claim that their society doesn’t have this trend? This is very much a global problem.
<br><br>
I strongly agree with the part saying that money cannot buy happiness. Life should not be one purchase after another, we all have a purpose in this world. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the very top of the pyramid is self-actualization. Knowing that you are doing something with your life that has meaning is the best thing you could be happy with. 
<br><br>
But I doubt this trend will ever be stopped or reversed. Our social structure consists of wealthy people and less so wealthy people. There will always be people wanting that wealthy life. Making a simpler life a trend will alleviate this but people’s thirst for wealth will never be quenched.

I agree that the trend for wealth and luxurious materials will be difficult to reverse. We are born into the consumer culture and idealize the American dream. I also see that the media has a great effect on our consumer culture. Everything we see on the media involves owning large houses, luxurious cars, a full closet, etc. People tend to miss the purpose that we must be content with our way of life the way rather than finding content through material items.
   <br><br><hr><br>
   I have the same doubt. Advertising is a 150 billion dollar industry, and things that massive don't just go away because it's in our best interest. I'd like to believe that it will, but I can't understand how aside from the miracle of everyone in the U.S deciding to live free of possessions. Coincidentally, I'm writing these comments on the day of the super bowl, which is known for the millions of dollars poured into a few seconds of advertising space in hopes of sending profits through the roof. Super bowl ads are taken about as seriously as fine works of art, and are worth the same amount. This is pretty scary, but a reality. I like them too. I also touched on the idea of making a simpler life a trend in my other comment. I think that trends have massive impacts (they've made people do some pretty stupid sh*t in the past). It's all about making the trend last by turning it into a movement, and eventually the social norm.
<br><br>
I like that you touched on the idea of purpose. People in first world countries are primed to pick a job where they'll make as much money as possible. Then they pursue that route, and if they succeed, they often live out their days feeling lost and just end up working more. Alienating their friends and family in the process. The American Dream is often a depressing character study. I was planning to do the same thing up until I took English 22. Before, I felt I would do something that makes enough money and concentrate on my passions on the side. I also felt comfortable because I had a plan. Now I'm not sure and I feel a little confused, but I feel like I want to do something that I feel touches on my purpose. If there's anything I've learned from this class, it's that money is not equal to happiness.

This documentary is eye-opening for me since I have only seen minimalist lifestyles on YouTube, and I’ve never seen anyone actually carrying out this lifestyle in real life. One essential question foregrounded by this documentary is: what do we live for? Are we actually living the life for ourselves, for meaningful relationships, for growth? Or are we, in fact, living for materials and substances? In the lack of personal satisfaction, we fulfilled our spaces with tons of meaningless objects; in the absence of emotional satisfaction, we followed fast fashion by buying tons of unnecessary items. This materialism is closely related to climate change, as it hugely increases our carbon footprints. For example, the fast-fashion items that make the factories release dark smoke into the air, as well as the expensive cars that boost the atmospheric carbon dioxide, warming up the global temperature. However, I do not think it is realistic to promote this minimalist lifestyle in real life and enforce it on every single person. Blindly buying so many things is irrational, but blindly throwing things away is also unlogical. Although I understand that the minimalist lifestyle does cover basic needs, I highly doubt that every person will be willing to leave every other item behind--it’s just not possible for us at this time. What I do really appreciate is this one idea from the documentary: it’s all about keeping a balance. Maybe it’s not realistic for all of us to become minimalists right now, but it is also possible for us to do what we can to mitigate environmental problems. Specifically, we can stop following fast-fashion; we can use more public transportation methods; we can stop buying things that aren’t going to play a part in our daily living routines. As a result, instead of promoting minimalism, we should direct our attention to those small actions that could make a big difference. In other words, striking a balance between our current carbon-rich lifestyles and the minimalist lifestyles.

I completely agree with everything you said, which is why I am very happy that Ken chose this documentary for this week. To reduce our carbon footprint, we have to stop the excessive consumerism and materialism that drives this country. I guess we don't even realize how much excessive and unnecessary stuff we own and how much we are influenced by our society constantly telling us what we need to buy next. I especially loved the clips about clothing, for instance when Joshua Fields Millburn showed us what he packed in his suitcase for a 10-month-tour. My first reaction was "how can he fit everything into that tiny bag?!", but then I really started to think about it and realized how little we actually need to get by. Out of all the stuff in my closet, I probably only wear 40% of it. That's not just because I prefer those 40% of clothing items, but rather because there aren't enough days in a month to wear all my other clothes. Especially since weather changes and in a few weeks I won't be able to wear my sweatshirts anymore because it's getting warmer again. We all own so much stuff that we don't even know what to do with all of it.
<br><br>

However, I do have to agree with you that it is not realistic for everyone to live the way the people that are shown in the documentary do. Of course, not everybody is willing to throw away all their clothes and move into a tiny house that they can barely walk in. That being said, I don't think the message of the documentary was to convince people to be as minimalistic as possible and condemn them if they want to own a second pair of sneakers. Instead, the idea of minimalism is about choosing the items that have the most value to us and bring us the most happiness, and realizing that we do not actually need all of the rest. I think that everybody is capable of being more considerate and conscious of what items they buy and for what reason. Nobody is saying that you can't buy a second jacket because you already own one. Maybe your other one isn't warm enough or the material was not the best. However, most people don't think about that when going shopping. The only thing that matters to them is what looks best or is trendy right now. So in that sense, it is absolutely possible to refuse to cave in to our materialistic society and instead choose to value quality over quantity. 
<br><br>
The last words spoken in the documentary really stuck with me: "Love people, and use things, because the opposite never works." I totally agree with this statement and I believe that everyone should think about that. If we keep relying on material goods to provide us with happiness, we will never be satisfied. There will always be something bigger, better, more expensive, more valuable out there. Minimalism helps you to see what really matters in life and what will truly be apart of finding happiness - people, not things.

When I first found out about tiny houses I couldn’t really wrap my head around how someone could live in such a small space, and to be honest, I still can’t. However, I don’t think we have to downsize quite that much in order to improve our lives and help the environment simultaneously. Simply moving away from materialism/consumerism and towards minimalism would make a huge difference. 
<br><br>
After watching the documentary, I was extremely surprised to see how much minimalism could improve someone’s life. I think the most apparent example of this was how the woman with MS saw physical improvement just by getting rid of a large amount of her material possessions. If “stuff” adds extra stress to our lives, then why do we want more of it? The answer is consumer culture. And to answer Ken’s question, I really do think that we may be able to get enough people to go along with “minimalism” to reinvent our materialist culture. If a handful of people can live in tiny houses that are barely 350-400 square feet, then surely most of us can live in apartments. And, like the documentary mentioned, most people only actually use 40% of the space of their house. Extra formal dining rooms, living rooms, etc. don’t serve a great enough purpose to justify us having them, especially if it hurts the environment. Even if everyone could just give up a little bit of their stuff or give up buying unnecessary things, we could completely change culture. I think a good example of this is the decrease in use of plastic straws. While I don’t think that having reusable straws was necessarily the way to go, I think it is a perfect example of how a huge number of people are capable of making a change for the better as awareness spreads.

I too was intrigued when I first found out about the whole tiny house concept, especially since it was on HGTV with an entire show dedicated for people trying to make the switch from huge houses to essentially nothing. Many on the show were on-board with the idea of minimalism, and I'm wondering if this was inspired by the Minimalists that this documentary was about. I definitely agree that not everyone needs to make such a radical change, but simply being mindful about the purchases that we as consumers make can completely change how we feel in such a consumer-driven, capitalistic market. While capitalism is certainly good for the welfare and convenience that it brings to us, it is the main reason that consumerism has soared recently, completely shifting how our economy acts as a whole. Now that cheap goods are readily available due to bulk production and manufacturing, we as consumers feel less of a sense to reflect on our purchases since they are small amounts of money anyways. Eventually, we end up with so many of these "small purchases" and often its the case that they are just collecting dust, replaced by the next "small purchase."
<br><br>
I also agree with your proposal that "most of use can live in apartments" since its being done in so many places besides the United States. In places like Tokyo or Japan, there isn't much space to begin with, so the people of those cities are restricted to living such a conservative lifestyle, keeping things that will only be useful to them and not because they simply wanted them. I think its also super important to bring social media into this conversation, because kids all over the world see celebrities in LA and Hollywood and want to live extravagant lives like them, making it their goals to be as successful and wealthy as them. We, as a generation, need to start spreading the right kinds of messages, because if not than it will all be too late.
<br><br><hr><br>
I fully agree with the first part of your comment regarding how the lifestyle presented in "Minimalism" can be actually implemented by people on a large scale. I think that while the concept of radical minimalism is compelling and the film certainly captured my interest, it is unrealistic to expect people to take on the minimalist lifestyle to such extreme ends. I also think that for most people viewing such extreme lifestyle changes as the only solution to the problem can cause people to ignore the small changes they can easily make that are less exciting and flashy but still important steps to combatting the problem. In his intro video, Ken raised this question of viability and I think that the mindset of minimalism is viable but expecting people to implement it in every part of their life is unrealistic and we cannot rely on it to solve the problem of climate change. Yet, holding the mindset that we should always question what we actually need can help us make small lifestyle choices that are easy and don't even require much sacrifice. 
<br><br>
The part of the other film (I had previously watched Minimalism) that talked about toys and kids was particularly interesting to me since it made me reflect on my own upbringing and how I think the reliance on consumer goods can have broader effects than just the environmental impact of a single item. For instance, when I was a kid I was lucky to never be surrounded by toys and I mostly found joy in exploring outside, without being entertained by consumer items. Because of this, I had the opportunity to enjoy my surroundings and develop a love for being content with experience instead of material possessions. If kids are constantly surrounded by toys and driven to acquire them through advertisements, it becomes more unlikely that they will develop a close relationship with the outdoors, which I think helps make people care more about the environment. In turn, such an upbringing can cause people to be less receptive to arguments pressuring people to forgo some material possessions to save the environment.

I personally think that yes we should try our absolute hardest to convert society as a whole into a minimalistic society. This is not to say that everyone would only have their basic needs met and that’s it. That would take all the fun out of life. But I do think that minimalism is a very valid and beneficial type of lifestyle, as it promoted getting rid of all the excess. Having gadgets upon gizmos and so many things and so many types of the same things, people consume way more than they could ever need and could really ever want. People are buying things not because it makes them truly happy for longer than a week or two, but because they want to keep up the appearance of traditional “success” as defined by society; having a ton of stuff and a ton of money. I think that if people could switch their definitions of success and transform them from material wealth to emotional wealth and wealth in relationships and wealth in the adventure of life, then things would look a lot different. I think that they do a great job of conveying this message in the Minimalism documentary. They explain that if a person gets great happiness and use out of his book collection, then by all means he should keep it. But a person who buys things just to have them, or just to show them off to his neighbor, or to fill a void will do so without success and often with the opposite result. I think that people get way too attached to material things and put much of their worth into the amount of nice things they own. I like to live my life in such a way that if my house and all my belongings were to be burned down tomorrow, I would still be happy. I would still have amazing friends and family that I love spending time with. I still have the public library I can rent books from. I still have all the wonderful nature around me. I still can start a garden or go to the park or soak up the sunshine. I would way rather spend my money on experiences than on things, and on hobbies like gardening that I really enjoy and that coincidentally help the planet. This month I am going to be going through all my things and selling or donating anything I don’t need and that doesn’t bring me joy and from now on I am going to really think through every purchase and ask myself whether it is something I really need.

I have read the short youtube video Visualizing a Plenitude Economy. I don't agree with the view in the video at all. The central point of the Plenitude Economy is that the worker works less time than they can have more time to do their own things, like DIY everything, do it yourself. The speaker believes when people have less income they will spend less money and consume fewer things, and DIY things. I don't agree with this at all. As this is an idealization, how do you know when people have less income, are they going to do things with less wasting? No one can answer this question. Also, people who are poor are the group of people who want to works more to earn income. When they work less, they can't even earn enough for their living. Therefore, this is a ideal theory, which most likely can not be true.

I liked how Minimalism opened with such a visual scene that showcased the stark differences of life. It opens with a crowd of shoppers on Black Friday anxiously trying to get whatever they are able to, and then it immediately transitions to a calm, peaceful countryside with no people and something that is very relaxing. Before, I knew that minimalism was a good way to help the planet, but now I realize that minimalism is necessary if we want to save this planet from this climate crisis that we are in. Materialism is something that we have known since we were young, and that we believed we could get more happiness from having certain things in our life when in reality we didn’t really need that. Minimalism, an opposite to materialism, kind of makes most people think that it is something bad and that we won’t be happy if we practice it. However, we all need to realize that minimalism will make the earth happy and overall our lives so much better. If we focus on having less, we won’t be constantly in need of something new to temporarily make us happier. Appreciating what we have and having mainly necessities in our life with only a few luxuries can make our lifestyles so much healthier not only for us but also for the planet that we live on.

I wouldn't say that materialism is the opposite of minimalism at all. Minimalism doesn't suggest a lack of worldly possessions at all, rather it calls for a dramatic reduction in the amount of goods and material items that we do own. As seen in Walden, the narrator still has a place to live, and still owns clothes and other possessions, but has abandoned the lifestyle of constantly obtaining these types of items, especially those which we don't really need. Minimalism does have merit in calling for a return to nature and only keeping the things we truly need, I believe that there should be a discussion on exactly how much a person needs in today's society, one that doesn't allow for us to convert back to a Walden-esque way of living as conveniently as Thoreau's did. We would definitely be able to convert to smaller homes and less food, but what about things like television and laptops, things we use to stay in connection to information and news all over the world. Would these things be considered necessities or not? I believe they would given that communication on a global scale is one of the things that best defines our modern age, but I know that it would be just as easy to make an argument against their need in our daily lives.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree with you.  Minimalism goes against the society we were raised and now participate in, which is crazy to actually think about.  The superfluous toys, clothes, and maximum living space that is the ultimate goal in our culture is extremely unnecessary.  Not only that, it doesn’t bring happiness.  Like shown in the film, “Minimalism” (whose short name is quite fitting), talked about the fact that much of the stuff we think we need or even want would not actually bring us joy.  Instead it leaves us yearning and unhappy, which is the problem with living for money.  When your main goal is to have more, more, more, your contentment with life in the present becomes less, less, and less. I enjoyed hearing about the different possible ways to combat that lifestyle, such as the idea of having only 33 items of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc.  It is a great way to think about life, to have what you need and nothing more.  By doing that, much of the pressure of life is removed, and you are free to focus on things that bring true fulfillment in life. Like you said, not only is this helpful for our individual wellbeing, but by living minimalistically we allow our planet to live healthily.

As said by Jesse Jacobs, “We are encouraged to maintain the addiction through technology and information.” This statement encapsulates the power of advertising and the cyclical process of consumption that our modern world has become. Not only are we degrading our earth through these habits, but we are depriving ourselves of a meaningful life. One part of the film that resonated with me was the fact that one of the minimalists said that each of his belongings served a purpose and he got rid of anything that didn’t bring value into his life. I find this very impactful; it’s true that we should only own things that add to our lives, rather than buy whatever we want and let it sit on our shelves and in our closets after a week. The modern consumer culture promotes the fact that “money is power” and blinds us to what success and happiness truly are. We need to wake up and realize that more stuff doesn’t mean more happiness. Money is the source of this addiction and controls the decisions we make. Money fuels the motivation of so many destructive companies and political powers. One of the minimalists explained that he was living for stuff, living for a paycheck, and not even truly living. We get stuck in this cycle of consumption that we are blind to our habits and fool ourselves into believing that falling deeper into that cycle will lead to happiness. Once you step back and realize that the objects and stuff you own don’t define your personal identity and don’t make you who you are, you are able to let go and live for yourself rather than live for what you own.

I 100 percent agree with you on the fact that we as consumers have been incredibly selfish in our shopping habits. We are willingly supporting fast fashion which contributes to clothing waste that is destroying our planet. Not only are we polluting our planet through fast fashion, but we are also WILLINGLY supporting sweat shops where people work ridiculous hours and yet make close to nothing.

The film introduced us a different type of life style, known as minimalism. This means to live a life with only necessary objects you need. From my point of view, there might be a little exaggeration to call it minimalism as I think it is just another type of life choice. They are satisfied with only a few objects; while other normal people, like me, want as more luxuries as possible. They do not need a job with high earning while for me, I need to have a high-paid job in order to foster my parents and my little sister. In conclusion, different lives in different regions leave different choices for people. 
<br><br>
However, for this course, I have to admit that one of the root causes for current climate disaster is the lifestyle we are having right now- maximalism. This is because we want to buy more clothes, more cars and more objects just to “fill the hole”. For me, that is to only give me sense of security and pure joy. During this process, large amount of carbon emission is created. 
<br><br>
Why are we choosing this lifestyle? How to change the choice we have made? The answers to both of the question can be deduce from the content of the film. Advertisement is the one who created this illusion for what lifestyle is the perfect one we should live with. Marketing to children is more of an education of desired lifestyle from childhood.

I like this film a lot. I think this is the best film I have watched this quarter. This does not mean other films are not good, but the topic of this film, minimalism, is a kind of life I look forward to having in the future. Some people may ask why minimalism is related to environmental protection? The truth is that one of the major causes of pollution is wasting. Do people remember the first film we watched this quarter, The Truth Cost? That film talks about how the clothing industry pollutes our environment. And the minimalism teaches us to use and live with fewer things, which is exactly about how to protect our environment. Besides protecting the environment, minimalism also gives us a happier life. When we have fewer things, we spend less time on choosing. And we will have less comparison with others. For example, under minimalism life, we have fewer clothes, than we spend less time on choosing what to wear every day and we won't compare our clothes with others. I think this is a perfect living way. I like minimalism and trying to live in a minimalism way.

Minimalism is an exciting solution to a wide spectrum to many of life's problems. So much of our lives are clouded in excess. In many cases, we don't feel comfortable without an excess of it. This film shows how minimalism is a solution to these problems. It allows us to declutter not only our homes but our lives in general. I'm glad that this film clarified a lot of the misconceptions about minimalism and living a minimalism lifestyle. Prior to this documentary, I thought living a minimalist lifestyle meant that you only lived off of what you needed to barely survive. I thought minimalism was simply a lack of consumerism. As Joshua points out, consumerism is not the problem. There is a spectrum of minimalism. You don't necessarily have to live on the extreme end to be a minimalist. Minimalism is just the process of getting rid of your excess. I can definitely see how minimalism can solve a lot of my problems. I waste so much of my time worrying about if I have enough. A departure from that kind of attitude would be incredibly liberating. Overall, I really enjoyed the film's message. As a result, I have opened up to my bad habits and have already started getting rid of what I don't need. It brings a richer and more purposeful quality to my life which I can't be more appreciative for.

One of the things I miss most about being home is my mom and I’s shopping dates. Everyday we’d stop by stores after practice and work– even if it was almost 11pm– and go to Ross to ‘see what they have’. Nearly every single time, we would walk out with bags and bags of clothes or items we don’t need, but because it was so cheap, we would just buy it anyway. These items would eventually stack up against each other and we would put it in a box to either send it to my family in the Phillipines or drop it off at Goodwill. And if you haven’t noticed yet, I didn’t grow up very minimalistic. Like most people (especially Filipino mothers), my mom was taught that you were only as successful as the things you own. It didn’t matter about anything else as long as you have the most gaudy items to display to your friends on Facebook. If you are Filipino, you are only considered successful if you buy your mom a Louis Vuitton bag. Minimalism was not a word in my mother’s vocabulary; in fact, she hated thrift stores, we always shopped in bulk of items that would go bad in a week, and our second car garage is filled with boxes and boxes of clothes and items we no longer used. I didn’t understand that this was a problem until I grew up and started going to my friends’ houses. I’d see that they have less things than me or that their house wasn’t so jumbled, and I would just step back and question their lives because mine is what was right because that is all I knew. 
<br><br>
It never registered to me that having less can you make even happier; I always believed (and still do) in the latter. Like most, my parents have always told me to get rich so I can buy them this big house and buy them everything they want. That has always been the dream, and still is. I guess I see where they are coming from, but I disagree with them in some parts. They say money can’t buy happiness– but money can solve a lot of problems that can make a lot of people happy. Most of the people who choose to live a minimalistic lifestyle are those higher up in the status of wealth. They have the choice to live their life a certain way because they have the means to stop whenever they choose. These are the people who travel the world with only one bag or those who only have 40 items to their name, much like the figures interviewed in the documentary. This sort of minimalism requires a certain amount of security — of knowing where your next meal is coming from, so to speak. The wealthy have the means to buy such high quality items at an expensive price point (which last forever) allowing them to only have a selected number of items, while those who only earn minimum wage can’t afford to buy a pair of $100 shoes and instead go the cheaper route. The catch is that although it may be cheaper, they do not last, meaning that that person has to continue buying the same pair of shoes over and over again therefore spending more money. I read an article about this a couple of years ago and it stated, “A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.” 
<br><br>
Ken stated that “this is a first world solution to a first world problem”, and I completely agree. Although living minimalistically may be financially and environmentally better, it is not as easy as they make it out to be. Yes, it will help you find freedom in things you have never noticed before. Yes, it will help you realize the importance of your items and your connection to the world. But it isn’t the end-all-be-all solution that we think we need. It is just another solution for the rich to downplay their wealth.

I definitely resonate with your experience with materialism in Filipino families. In fact, now that I’m older, I realize that my mother primarily showed her love for my sister and I while we were growing up by buying unnecessary items that would end up in storage. My sister gets a lot of her clothes from thrift stores, and my mom disapproves of it greatly as she doesn’t want us to have “secondhand” items. 
<br><br>
I’ve always disliked the idea that people, in general, need to show off their items in order to prove that they have wealth. It was even more frustrating coming from a low income background because it felt like we were supposed to hide our status behind expensive clothes or purses we didn’t need, and in turn, it felt like we were supposed to be ashamed of our real backgrounds. At the same time, though, I can somewhat understand the appeal of being able to afford a materialistic luxury - I admit I have been guilty of this. However, “Minimalism” shows us that it is entirely possible to live without these things. And though these people presented in the documentary are content with what they have, it makes me wonder how exactly I can personally dismantle my desire for materialistic things.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree. I find joy in a lot of material "things". I do think that living a more minimalistic life can help people "find" themselves and feel better about themselves. I also see it as a trendy thing to do so one can show how much better their lifestyle is than everyone else who is obviously much worse than them for appreciating "things". I am well aware it is possible to live without a nice big house, or luxury car, or nice clothes, a swimming pool etc... but if I am able to have these things, why shouldn't I. Just because a few people on the internet made a documentary to tell me how much happier i will be by living a minimalist lifestyle, does not mean it is true for me or for every-person. I do believe their message that minimalism has its values that can help some people find meaning, but not for everyone. They continue to claim that minimalism helps people become happier and less depressed. I would like to see these studies and cases that prove this point rather than believe with no doubt these film makers are unbiased in their agenda. 
<br><br>
Looking at minimalism from a environmental viewpoint seems much more impactful. Much of the co2 being put into the atmosphere is due to manufacturing that really isn't "necessary". If more people adopt this minimalistic lifestyle the demand for items will go down, which may eventually lower emission rates from massive companies as welI as from individual people. 
<br><Br>
This documentary is thought provoking and makes people question why they buy what they buy and what true meaning it has to them. As with most documentaries, this one makes a point, shows evidence, and seemingly proves themselves. I am curious to see other peoples experiences (not the few shown in the film with obvious success) with minimalism and if it actually made them happier.
 <br><br><hr><br>
Your comment really strikes a resonant chord because of the way you described how your parents want you to get rich to buy them a big house and everything they want. The thing I've heard for as long as I can remember is to get rich so I can buy my parents a mansion, and for years and years that's exactly the goal that I've associated with success. I never even questioned whether or not a mansion would even be desirable or the environmental implications of something so uselessly consumerist as a gigantic mansion. I just associated wealth and luxury with success because, and I think this is a key point,  my parents grew up in poverty being from a third world country, so the chief goal of their life has been to ascend the economic ladder to reckless billionaire status. I think the important thing to take away here is how common this story is for people coming from third world countries or less developed areas: the single-minded goal of their parents, now passed on to them, to get rich, just to emulate the lives of those above them. It's important to note that this desire comes from a place of the exact opposite, that the desire to consume and consume and consume comes from a place of forced minimalism by poverty, and think that's why minimalism is a weak solution to the climate crisis. It only works in changing the lifestyles of those already economically accomplished, but the real danger is the burning desire to be rich and consumerist and wasteful in the minds of the less well-off. Minimalism can't solve that, because happiness is necessarily linked with consumerism in the minds of those less well-off.

Throughout watching this film one of the only things I could focus on was the fact that both Nicodemus and Miller were in a place in their life where they were financially stable to live a minimalist lifestyle as you mentioned. Growing up I knew many families who didn't have more than a few pairs of clothes and not a whole lot of unnecessary furniture in their homes. This wasn’t because they were trying to live a minimalist lifestyle, but rather they simply couldn't afford it. I’m sure this put both the children and adults in stress, unlike the freeing mindset that the film was describing. The point I am trying to make is that these families who couldn’t afford most things strived to obtain more material things because they believed that’s what will make them happy. I believe anyone in that situation would want to know what it would be like to own a home with a three-car garage and have a stable job. I also believe that they wouldn’t understand why material things won’t make them happy until they do have them and have that realization on their own, but until then it will be their goal to make more money and buy more things
 <br><br>
Although I want to stay positive and hope that everyone will have a go at the minimalist lifestyle, most people will always crave for more and more material things simply because it is ingrained in not only the American culture but many other cultures around the world. People will always feel like they are and should be chasing something that they can’t have.

Thank you for sharing your personal experience and presenting a different view on the topic. I think with California's political demographic, we often find ourselves agreeing on everything a little too much and it doesn't lead to any valuable discussion (just people repeating the same things). I do think that minimalism has the potential to be more than a solution for the rich to appear more down-to-Earth. "A Plenitude Economy" did a good job covering the national economic benefits and the social benefits of making a lifestyle change, but there isn't much attention on personal financial benefit. Lifestyle improvement should in no way be something that you have to be privileged to do. Unfortunately eating healthy is still difficult for those who can only afford pay into the fast food industry. Minimalism can be extremely affordable! My experience with thrifting has been that you can get some really high quality and long lasting items at low prices. Also, I think that if the United States starts moving towards implementing more social safety nets like Northern Europe has, then struggling people will be able to live their lives with more financial freedom. Until then, community programs and shared housing should be an affordable option to anyone who wishes to live more sustainably.

 I completely agree and resonate with your response. I have, for a long time, used things as something to look forward to in life. Whenever I'm sad or having a bad day, I go on the urban outfitters site and try to make myself feel better. However, whenever I buy something, I'll end up wearing it once and then get sick of it. This is an ever-present pattern in my life and it's one I'm not proud of. One of my new year's resolutions is to "want" less. I want to do this because I know that there is more to life to create happiness than things. After watching Minimalism, I was incredibly inspired to start living with less and create happiness by doing things that make me happy, instead of buying things. Not only is it better for one's mental health, living a minimalistic lifestyle is so much better for the environment- which is something that is so important to me.
<br><br><hr><br>
 After watching the film, "Minimalism" I realized that there are so many people that purchase so many things and they indeed do not need half of them.  A very good example that was given was clothing.  A lot of people can relate to this because more than half do it.  People feel the need to buy clothes, because of the "fashion" statement.  Humans are wired to be dissatisfied.  Companies want you to believe that you want things such as cars, phones, clothes.  This is true companies put out advertisements and pitches as to why you need these items.  When in reality you do not necessarily need all of these items or the newest version.  In the case of phones, companies convince you that you need the latest version because it is bigger and better than older versions.  For example, iphones, these devices every year get bigger and with a new feature.  They are pitched to people because the bigger the better.  And as humans we naturally want the newest and best thing.  We feel like we need these things.  Not only for phones but as well as cars.  People constantly want the fastest, luxury and overall best car.  This is a major problem because motor vehicles are a big cause of CO2 emission into the atmosphere.  And when people are constantly making new cars every year the problem gets worse and worse.  With these new luxurious cars out on the marker people go and buy them, and not just one car but multiple cars.  Once again people do not need more than one car, in fact they do not need any car at all.  It is so much better to travel on bike, or public transportation.  People can not realize and do not realize the harm in buying new items constantly.
<br><br><hr><br>
This consumption that you talk about reminds me of when the minimalists are talking in "Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things" in that it is compulsory consumption that is such a problem in our time. I think, and have commented this before, that consumption is essential to our economy, and that being consumers is not the worst thing in the world. However, the amount of needless consuming is crazy and that is 100% unnecessary and contributing to our wastefulness as a planet. 
<br><br>
I think that it is important for us to be able to self-regulate and reduce the stigma over wearing thrifted clothes, or hand me downs, as our "need" to keep buying new brand name clothes is contributing drastically to our wastefulness. Also, this will stop us from measuring success in the things that we own, but instead measure success on the quality of our character that has developed.
<br><br>
I thought that the Minimalism documentary was super interesting. While it has not necessarily inspired me to go completely minimalist as they have, it has inspired me to think about what I actually need in my life. There is plenty of stuff that I own that I tell myself I cannot throw out because I will either need to use it or want to have it in the future. The reality of it is that this is rarely the case. and I can end up buying things that I only use a few times, and then keeping it and not giving it to someone who might actually use it and not waste by having them buy a new one. In any case, I think that I will definitely do some introspection at home and see if there are things that I have bought without needing to and see if I can find them a better home.
<br><br><hr><br>
your words remind me of some of my same experience back in China, because of the rapid development of China in these decades, people gradually start to have good life defined by living wealthily. What is funny about this is that living a good life is actually defined by living wealthily instead of living happily, and living wealthily somehow defined by people that it is equally to living happily. People get interested in luxury brands regardless whether they truly like it or not, while the real rich ones live a simple life. The whole society is rushing making the people within it anxious too.
<br><br>
While voluntary Minimalism, meaning rich people can buy a lot of stuff while they choose not to, is a upper stage of living a rushing life giving people the real freedom they want. I think Minimalism is better, since it requires people to look over greediness and money to fine the purity in everyone’s heart.
<br><br><hr><br>
I can relate with you, one of my favorite childhood memories is going on  shopping sprees with my mom. We would go to outlets and buy so much stuff, convinced that we were getting a good deal because of the “sale” sign. We’d come home with so many shopping bags  each time, but now I look back at it, we already had more than enough clothes at home. There have been so many occasions where my mom has handed me a large trash bag, telling me to put any clothes I don’t want in there. I’ve filled up so many large trash bags with the clothes I have accumulated over the years. Of course we donated these clothes though. 
<br><br>
My parents are also counting on me to be successful and to make lots of money so I can buy them a nice, big house. And of course I’m going to do that because I owe them that much for raising me with so much love.  Who am I to judge what makes them happy? They worked so hard for the majority of their adult life. Sure, it’s materialistic to think that a nice, big house will make you happy, but would  anyone choose living in some crowded, small house to a nice, big one? Sure, a minimalist life is ideal,  but growing up with little makes you strive to obtain more. I’m not ashamed to say that one of my priorities in life is to become successful so I can buy myself and my family nice things. I completely agree with you that living a minimalist lifestyle is not as easy as the documentary makes it out to be.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really enjoyed reading your comment, because I agree with everything you had to say. I also appreciated you sharing your own story with your family. My parents both grew up with nothing, both coming from immigrant families, so them being financially stable enough to buy things they had always wanted was part of their American Dream. Coming to UCSB was big for me because it meant securing a college education and a good paying job. I think a lot of people tie success to things and that is just how our world is. I have always wanted to be able to buy myself nice things, and repay my parents for all they have done to me. I guess I had never really thought about how detrimental it is to our planet. That being said, I do feel sort of bad for wanting these things now, knowing that it will only contribute to the problem.

I appreciated how the documentary reflected the toxic nature of materialism that can affect people’s emotional well-being; however, I acknowledge that not all people may view it as such a toxic component of their life or detrimental to them. Although the teachings that Minimalism: A Documentary discussed about reducing excess materials and keeping the ones that would actually be put to use made sense, I definitely do agree that their shifts seemed radical, such as the transition to a tiny house or fitting everything they owned in two suitcases. While I understand that this isn’t what they are exactly pushing, I honestly don’t believe people would be able to make this transition and alter their lifestyles. Although it is something we would hope for in which people could realize the environmental impact of their lifestyle, I don’t have faith in the mass to do such a thing as I believe the influence of consumerism and value towards material possession outweighs the situation in the perspective of most people. While they managed to show how minimalism benefitted a few groups of mostly individuals, a couple, and a family, it is important to acknowledge that this transition to minimalism wouldn’t be fit for all people, as situations vary between all families or groups to undergo such a change. This is where the disconnect of minimalism comes into play or just the lifestyle changes introduced to benefit action against climate change come into play for many families, who may not have the will, financial stability, or some other circumstance to take that initiative. Overall, I believe this disconnect arises out of people not viewing the climate crisis as their most prioritized problem, and this is a danger to all of humanity. While the documentary did show me another perspective on a toxic aspect of American culture with its illusion of what our life should look like and for it to be perfect or how  advertising has polluted our culture, I believe not everyone may share such similar values, and I don’t believe this is the “greatest” solution we have available to combat climate change. This doesn’t mean I am disregarding the significance of such alterations and the current consequences of consumerism with its impact on the environment, but ultimately, I am pessimistic towards the timeline we are currently on. Hopefully, by the end of this course, I will be more pessimistic of our future and the capability of the public to enact change.

After watching the film, “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I was really left with the question is this something I should consider? As I am sure for many people in the United States, from a young age they were presented with the idea of what the American dream is and why it should be pursued. This ideology consists of getting a high paying job in order to live a materialistic life which ultimately will make you seem very desirable. This concept is one of few that are often viewed as the way of living life by many people in this country with no real alternative. What this film does is debunk everything we thought about the American dream and showing the sad realities of it. As Minimalists the two men in this film go around explaining that happiness cannot be bought and that life should be lived by value and not material. The film began by explaining humans tendency of constantly wanting more than what they already have referring to it as an addiction encouraged by the illusions of the media. I thought this was very well said as it accurately depicts what is going on in the world today and rightfully exposing these larger companies for making consumers feel that they do not have enough. I have much respect for both men in this film, but Josh really spoke to me for some reason. The fact he went from corporate to minimalist is amazing to me and how he is able to properly justify each of his possessions is impressive. One of the most eye opening statements made in the film that stuck with me was, “the American dream is just a template not the template,” because I truly believe many people think otherwise as they are told so from a young age. Another good quote that made me think about minimalism from this film was, “we are living our lives depending on the space we have rather than creating space to fit our lives.” These two quotes were very impactful for myself and in a way help set me free from this modern way of thinking. 
<br><br>
As for my own personal life it was a good film to watch before I enter a career and really begin to think about what will bring me happiness. As a college student I do not own much, but yet feel like I have way too many possessions that I can definitely do without. As an individual I do have basic needs, but it is important to draw a distinction of what is necessary and what is not. I must realize that there is no problem with consumption, but it is the compulsory consumption that can lead into a downward spiral. Yet another benefit of being a minimalist is being able to be environmentally friendly with what I own and os something that I will always take into consideration. The only problem that I encountered while watching this film was the assumption that having more or less can make you as a person happy. Being a minimalist is not the only way to true happiness and feel like this film almost tried to advertise. Besides that I found the film very uplifting and inspirational as it is something I will certainly consider in the future.

Watching this film answered many questions for me, but also left me with many more. I also wondered if this is this something I should consider! After watching the Minimalist’s journey, I am definitely inspired to deep clean and declutter. The American dream has never settled easy with me because it seemed so problematic based on how you need a high paying job just to buy things to make you seem happier and cooler. As if the things we buy to fill our homes hold more value over the people in our homes. I appreciate how the film consistently emphasizes how mass consumption is the problem, not so much consumption, and how the media plays an important role in that. I agree that it’s a great way for them to expose these larger companies for making us think that we do not have enough. Exposing what these companies are doing is exactly what people need to see so that they are inspired to change their consumption patterns. How could you even want to be a part of the fast fashion world after learning about how companies destroy the clothes they throw out to prevent people from wearing them or selling them. Or after learning that they specifically change “seasons” every week to make us feel as though we are unfashionable the next week and must buy something else to look good. 
<br><br>
I’m right there with you on the feeling of owning so much but also not a lot. I look around my room and I see that my room isn’t necessarily cluttered, but I have plenty of things that I don’t need. It is so important to think about what is necessary and what’s not. We need to evaluate if what we buy is what we need or will bring us happiness. I really liked how Josh answered a person’s question by explaining that you don’t have to literally throw everything out and live out of a suitcase. You can keep your books and those things that make you happy, but you don’t need to keep those things from overconsumption. 
<br><br>
The film presents to me multiple plus sides to taking up a more minimalist lifestyle. You become more environmentally friendly, your perspective on values change, and you become happier. The film does make it seem like you need to have less to be happy, which isn’t true. Having more things doesn’t make you happy, but neither does the absence of things. However, I feel as though you become happier when you stop holding such high values on materialistic things and shift your values towards experiences, quality time and connections with people. We need to bring our communities closer together by taking the time to get to know each other instead of pepper spraying them when they get in your way on Black Friday. Where is the love? And where is the compassion that we used to have? Maybe a more minimalist mindset would bring that back.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you that the American dream should be more of a template not "the template". Although I agreed with the message of the film, I also think we shouldn't look down on those who don't choose to live a minimalist lifestyle. I've always been interested in eastern culture, philosophy, and religion because of their minimalist ways. To many eastern cultures and religions , the goal of life itself is to become free from materialistic attachment. I think if we looked at life like that more in the west, the environment would be in a much better condition than what it is. Most people here in America feel pressured to make material gain in order to make their family proud and be viewed as successful. Success is different for everyone. Most people would be considered successful if they owned a bunch of sports cars and a huge mansion. They would especially be considered successful if they owned a company.(even if that means a fracking /oil company) The problem with this mentality is that it encourages the production of materials that harm the environment. Although the film itself wasn't heavy on making a point on the environment, I think adopting a minimalist lifestyle would be highly beneficial. My only concern is in the ability of Americans to make the switch from a materialistic lifestyle to a minimalist one. 
<br><br>
I myself will try to live as minimal as possible, but I won't look down on those who choose to pursue material things. At the end of the day, you can't take your material possessions to the grave, so I wouldn't center my life around them. I hope people will take on minimalism or at least give it a try to see how it can be beneficial to not only them but also to the planet.
<br><br><hr><br>
I think the minimalist lifestyle is something everyone should consider. While we maybe don't have to take it to the extreme, we can at least consider the value of all of our possessions, and really question whether or not we actually need them and what purpose they serve in our life. I do appreciate the fact that they point out our obsession with getting more and more things to give us the illusion we are successful, happy, and fulfilled. But all these things are meaningless compared to our relationships, friends and family. I also thought that Josh's story was amazing. Had I been in the same position, it would have been a difficult decision. I appreciate all of their abilities to focus on what they truly need, not what they want.
<br><br>
I agree that it's a great documentary to watch, especially at the ages we are. Now is the time that we can implement ideas such as this easily, or at least easier than it will be later in life. Living as a college student and being on a budget has helped me consider what I really need in my life, and I have learned to not care for material possessions since I simply cannot afford them, or just don't want to put myself out to have them. I agree that they maybe stress a little too much that living this lifestyle is the way to happiness, but there is truth in it. It forces us to think about what we really value in life, and that should be the priceless things like friendship, love, and caring for others. Relationships are where we gain true meaning, not what we wear, what cars we drive, or how big a house we live in. Getting rid of the material things allows for us to focus more on meaningful relationships with others, and finding out who we are as individuals.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also felt the same way! The two quotes you pointed out from the film were really great and I completely agree with why they resonated with you. Many people are told that success is determined by the things you possess whether that be in the form of a big house, luxury items, etc. Although many people still believe that, the reality is that some of those things might not bring you happiness and a lot of the time go unused. It's true that many companies today make people go out and by these things in order for them to keep up with the trends. People oftentimes are convinced into buying these things to fit in and not look left out. 
<br><br>
I totally agree that as a college student I feel like I don’t have that much but there are still some things I could completely go without. The film inspired me to think about how I can change my lifestyle and what things will truly make me happy. Not only will there be fewer things to worry about, but being a minimalist will also have a positive effect on the environment by consuming and producing less waste.
<br><br><hr><br>
Its interesting to think about how our economy is basically based on our craving for more things, without our need for more things our economy would not thrive. I think its important to try to live more minimalist lives but the biggest barrier might be our own social culture. Perhaps we would be seen as less successful or weird because we dont have as many things or aren't striving to get more things. It would probably be hard for other people to understand how to achieve happiness by consuming less.
<br><br><hr><br>
Similar to what you said, the film also left me wondering if minimalism is a lifestyle that I would consider. The film did a really good job of highlighting the benefits of the minimalist lifestyle, with both the guys talking about how it's made them much happier and fulfilled in life. I agree it was admirable and also seemed more relatable how Joshua was working a corporate job but then decided to leave. It makes him more relatable for the audience, to know that he was buying into the same societal life "template" at one point, as most of us are. I was also impressed how Joshua could justify each item he owned, because I have a feeling I (and most others) could not do that, and I was surprised at how little clothing he packed for their months long tour. 
<br><br>
It was definitely an interesting film to watch as college students. Moving into a tiny, crowded dorm this year did make me reevaluate what I really needed, and I've noticed over the year that I probably bought too many clothes and possessions with me, as the room is usually cluttered and messy. And I admit, having a messy dorm does cause me a lot of stress. So yes, like you, I will definitely consider this lifestyle in the future, or at least move towards practicing aspects of it, even if it's just small steps.
<br><br><hr><br>
The film "Minimalism" absolutely influenced my views on how much I depend on "stuff" to boost my serotonin levels. You said that as a college student, you don't own much; I am currently looking around my dorm room and I have an abundance of crap that I probably don't need and then I also have stuff back home at my parent's house. I wish I could get rid of 75% of my things, but I don't know how to even start, and then of course I keep buying things. Our culture is trained to autocrave and then become dissatisfied. Through fast fashion and growing popularity of popular brands and their competition, there is an abundance of cheaper and more readily available items. It is true, our culture buys to fill a void. I thought it was interesting that they asked the question: "can money buy happiness?" and the answer was yes, but there is a threshold. How do we find the threshold? The one they we can control is spending less and having less, yes, but we are raised to have compulsory consumption. In America, consuming is one of the best things we do. 
<br><br><hr><br>
I have a few comments on the documentary itself. I felt that almost everyone in the film was white, which doesn't help show a diverse representation of the minimalist movement. It just showed several individuals who had good jobs who had the means to buy modern homes or quit their jobs and have a fresh start. Most people probably would not be able to do that as easily. The one scene where one of the Minimalists is reading an excerpt of his book in the desert was extremely melodramatic and I felt like it was just very distracting from the message itself. I did, however, like the message that minimalism is the tool to achieve freedom.

After watching "Minimalism", I was very interested in how reducing what we use everyday can greatly help our world from running out. While it may be hard for people to completely reduce their waste and go to an only minimalistic lifestyle, it doesn't seem as hard to look at how you are using everyday things, and just trying to cut back on one or two things to reduce your footprint. I think a lot of people don't realize that our earth only has a finite amount resources and once they're gone, they are gone so we should work to preserve those resources by minimizing our waste. After watching the film, it really made me think about my impact and how I can reduce my waste and try to live a more simple lifestyle.

With the onslaught of materials, it becomes hard to prioritize things and realize what actually is important in life, which is what the main character, Ryan, felt. He felt as if he had lost his direction, and that the consumption of more material goods was going to help him find it or bring him some sort of contentment. I can relate a lot to this; often times when I'm sad or have had a bad week, going on a shopping spree or "treating myself" is something that I've convinced myself will make me feel better. I've realized that this is a dangerous habit as its cyclical nature just makes me get tired of what I already have and leaves me wanting more. This is said to be a "biologically based delusional craving", and as humans we are wired to become dissatisfied which is exactly what happens in the aftermath of me being material goods. Every possession should serve a purpose or bring one joy. One important thing that Josh said that stuck out to me was when he said "Does this add value to my life, and if not I have to be willing to let go". I feel as if this could be applied not only to to the act of getting rid of unnecessary materials but also toxic people in life. It is important to cleanse one's life from negative energy and excessive things because as Josh mentioned, it makes one feel more free, leading to a happier outlook on life. This short film really showed me the importance of only keeping what is necessary and cherished close to me, as the rest just provides weight. This can be used in the scape of the climate crisis, as treasuring the items I already have will provide me with a better outlook on the unnecessary act of buying more when what I have is all I need, reducing my carbon footprint.

Prior to watching the film, I had heard of and was very curious about minimalism. About a year ago, after I fell down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos that showed minimalist lifestyles, I did a big clean out of my room at home and got rid of a majority of may clothes and a lot of the excess stuff that I had around my room. The hardest part of this massive clean out was the desire to keep things that had sentimental value but had no value in my everyday lifestyle anymore. However, after I was done, I felt like I had removed some of the baggage that some of these pieces of clothing carried with them and that I was happier and less crowded in by my own bad spending choices. I think that by adopting a minimalist lifestyle, not only will I feel less restricted and cramped, I will also experience the financial, and sustainable aspects of minimalism. I believe that in this day and age, it would be very difficult for everyone to adopt a minimalist lifestyle; we are constantly surrounded by technology that pushes trends and new products down our throats and feeds the incessant consumer culture that has taken over American culture. One thing in the film that I found interesting was project 333. The founder, Courtney Carver wore 33 pieces of clothing for 3 months, which shows the audience that minimalism is possible and that there is not as much restriction as one may think. This project reminds me of the idea of a capsule wardrobe, a collection of only the most essential clothing in your wardrobe that can be worn throughout multiple seasons and will not go out of fashion. Project 333 and capsule wardrobes are both two examples that can help people realize that they do not need more to be happy; they should only have what is essential and in having only what we need, we can find happiness.

I can definitely relate to your comment that by adopting a minimalist lifestyle, you could feel free from bad spending choices and a weight lifted from your shoulders. I too have problems with sentiment and can want to keep everything for the sake of the memories associated with it. Society perpetuates the idea that having more will make you happier and you will appear rich and luxurious with such excess, arguably useless things.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you. With the advertising and prominence of new trends in social media, I feel like a lot of us feel like we have to spend our money to keep up with the modern world. Growing up, I dreamed of having a huge house with lots of rooms, but now having a massive home seems wasteful and pointless. As my friends and I talk about our future homes, I have always realized that these big homes are not a necessity, and the idea of owning  a large house is something that society seems to glorify. These homes are not functional, excessive, and require lots of electricity and instead we should try to move towards tiny homes.

This reminds me of the anime film “Your Name” where two kids are always searching for something or someone, but they don’t know what. It ultimately takes a leap of faith to run after what they actually need: each other and connection. It takes courage to refuse to follow the system and forge your own path. This movie is helpful not because it teaches about minimalism but because it encourages rethinking what I actually need, refusing the script, and leaving the system if needed. I already knew the actual “good life” isn’t actually being more rich or having more things. I knew what I wanted. I wanted to spend time with people I care about and do things I like. This movie inspired me to rethink the path to getting there. “I didn’t know what was important anymore” “I had what I needed. I should be happy”. These quotes from the movie resonate with me. I have people who care for me, I have good food and shelter, I have enough privilege to go to college. Although I know what ultimately matters, my plan to get that made me lose sight of it.

One thing I learned is the plentitude economy, as suggested by Juliet Schor, where people work less for money and have more time to do enjoyable activities. I would very much appreciate it if we had a plentitude economy. Then I could spend more time with people I care about, and they wouldn’t have to stress about making money as much. I want a cultural change so it doesn’t have to be just me.

The film, Minimalism, was very effective in informing me that a lot of material possessions I consider “necessities” are truly just meaningless objects masked by the desirability of consumer goods. Through advertisements and marketing ploys, our society believes that a specific standard of living is a given-we need all these luxuries to survive and achieve happiness. However, I now comprehend from a fresh perspective that my miscellaneous things are merely grasps at feeling like a part of our excessive culture, wanting to live the dream life everyone boasts about on media. In fact, I find myself frequently being lured into Instagram ads promoting sundresses, jean shorts, or other clothing items that I do not need, but the notion of online shopping is like an addiction. I feel that we have transformed pointless and reckless spending into a trendy aspect of our culture. Furthermore, in the film someone stated, “Material goods are only important for their symbolic meaning-what they do to position us in a status system”. I agree with this insight tremendously. I now ask myself, “Is this new item capable of adding deeper value to my life?” Most of the time, swiping the card for another pair of sunglasses, or purchasing a home for a couple with five bedrooms will not result in the perfect ending point our consumer culture has advertised. 
<br><br>
Additionally, it was touching to hear one of “The Minimalists” authors, Joshua, share about the passing of his mother. He mentioned how he wished he could have seen her more, during the period where he was tirelessly climbing the corporate ladder. If we are chasing jobs that will enable us to spend lavishly, we may be neglecting the foundational relationships that truly bring us happiness and purpose. I do not think it is worth working all hours of the day just for that fancy sports car or huge home that is intended to prove superiority.

In the documentary "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" introduces an absolutely new life way to peoples, which is opposite to most people's lives in modern society. 
<br><br>
Nowadays, I must be honest to admit that more and more people become an advocater of consumerism. People want to fulfill when they are trying to buy new stuff, no matter whether this thing is useful or not. They won't buy an item after careful consideration. People now are easier to get happy when they try to buy a new thing; however, as time went on, people will suddenly find that most items they have purchased are not useful.
<br><br>
To give an example about myself, when I was young, I like some toys, just like most girls do. I would beg my mother for a long time to get it and would cry out if she refused my request when she told me that you have enough toys at home. In introspect, now I can say that the actions I did when I was young belong to extravagance and waste, which is contradict to minimalism.
<br><br>
There is a word called "marginal utility." From my perspective, every people who want to learn about minimalism should first learn about the definition of this word. This word means that "the added satisfaction that a consumer garners from consuming additional units of goods or services." Buying the same thing more and more, the happiness you can get from this thing will become less and less. To give an example, I bought the first pair of shoes, which will make me feel happy about it. However, if I bought 10 pairs of shoes, I will become confused about which shoes I should wear and whether I have enough space to reserve these shoes. The happiness I can get from the eleventh shoes is much smaller than the confusion and worry that brought by these shoes. Now, we can begin to consider the "minimalism." Whether using the idea of minimalism can make us happier than now? 
<br><br>
From my perspective, I think that minimalism can be achieved one day. However, which level of minimalism should be performed by people should depend on themselves. Different people have different goals and different living environments. For some of them, they need to buy new things and new stuff because it may belong to their work, like models. However, people whose lives do not need them to consume a lot of things that may not be used in the future should not blindly follow. All people can achieve their own "minimalism" to the maximum extent.

I really agree with you that more and more people want to fulfill their voids by buying more stuff and don’t care whether the stuff is useful to them or not. Ryan Nicodemus said at the beginning of the documentary that there is a feeling of the gaping void in his life, and he tried to fulfill this void with lots of stuff. He then asked this friend Joshua Fields Millburn why he is so happy. Joshua said he is so happy because of minimalism. We can see in the documentary, Millburn packs for a trip, he uses a single duffle bag. He only packs a few T-shirts, a stack of underwear and socks, a laptop. He’s wearing his single pair of shoes and jacket, so he doesn’t need to pack them. I was shocked by all he needs for a ten-month trip is packed in this small bag. Looking at his house, he only owns things that add value to his life and let everything else go. Millburn and Nicodemus’s trip is on a mission to spread a message that less is more, which encourages people to live a simple life. I have to admit that my lifestyle is completely different from Millburn’s. I often buy many useless things such as clothes and shoes, and I have several clothes that I have never worn. As you said, I also learned the concept of “ describing marginal utility” in econ class, which indicates that buying the same thing more and more, the happiness you can get from this thing will become less and less. I believe this can explain why minimalism can make our life happier and more meaningful because we only focus on the things that really matter in life.
<br><br>
The film is inspiring. I think we should try to let as many people as possible to know more about this lifestyle. Giving up some material possessions opens people up to better human relationships and meaningful lives as well as save money and time.

The film " Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" had me divided into feelings towards it.  I find myself somewhere in the middle of a minimalist and materialistic person.   I respect the message the two men were sending which is that it is hard to find happiness in the materialistic society we live in today.  However, I found some topics I disagree with.  The place I disagreed with the film is on the topic of money.  The movie goes into depth about how money won't make you happy.  In my opinion, it can.  I am about to be in so much college debt it isn't even funny and if I had a job that paid $200,000 that I was indifferent towards or a job that paid $40,000 that I loved I would pick the $200,000  job any day of the week.  This is because even though I love the $40,000 job I would still be stressed with all the student debt I have piled up along with daily needs and wants.  I think it depends on the person if they can live the minimalist lifestyle.  For example, I would find it near impossible to give up my iPhone, the majority of clothes, and other things that I don't absolutely need.  But another person could just as easily throw away everything except the essentials in a blink of an eye.  These bring me to the point I agree with most in the film.  There isn't a set path for happiness and a good life, the materialistic path is just one of many paths to be happy.

I completely agree with your comment on this. I really enjoyed learning about their side of the story, claiming that materialistic things don’t make more a more meaningful and happy life. In my personal experience, especially as a student, money is a main focus of my life. I have more places to delegate money to then ever before, and looming student debt is a thing that gives me constant anxiety. Possibly if school was also considered materialistic and something unnecessary then yes, maybe money doesn’t make a person happier. But when you factor in the (necessary) expenses of the average American lifestyle, money is just one materialistic thing that a person genuinely needs to feel at ease in their life. This movie relates back to the Walden reading as the minimalist life is once again shown as the more sustainable/“better” option. As I said in my previous comment, as much as I completely understand and support this lifestyle, I don’t think I could happily live with those restrictions. I think limiting the aspects of materialistic life is the best course of action for me and for other students/people in general struggling with wanting to live sustainably but also needing things like money to feel internally free in the society that we live in.
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree! I think money is a powerful thing that can ease a lot of pain for many people, but it's just the job of the consumer to be able to use it wisely and in a way that isn't propagating the consumer culture that we are so entrenched in. The idea of eradicating or controlling our consumer culture however, is tough. It's playing a game between new technological innovations and our innate human desire for feeling like we have new things versus our planet. I honestly have no idea how we can even reverse or stop this from continuing. I'd be curious to see if this will be addressed in our environmental communication section. 
<br><br>
I thought the discussion on how living spaces can be greatly reduced is a really innovative and effective way to look at how we can strike a balance. The different layouts of the Life edited apartment styles was at first making me feel claustrophobic, but as I saw how different people in the film applied it, and just how cool the small living space made be curious to see one in person. I think for people living alone or small families, it's a very doable thing to be able to live with little. I also found the Project 333 idea really interesting, since it encourages a minimal sense of fashion, but doesn't compromise style, comfort, or self expression. I'd definitely not be opposed to trying it myself!
   <br><br><hr><br>
   I fully agree with you that there is no set path for happiness and a good life.  I find the significance behind, "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" is its exploration of just one alternative to the materialistic path, but as you had said, minimalism may not be the most comfortable path for many people, either.  I think it is very important to explore other ways to pursue happiness because of how much damage the materialistic lifestyle causes the environment.  However, people lack the motivation and the vision to do so.  
<br><br>
I have mixed feelings over the effectiveness of voluntary minimalism.  I think that the effectiveness of any voluntary effort is minimal.  Environmentally friendly trends such as thrift shopping are exceptions as they are persisted through social media and are thus tagged to a part of social expectations through the medium of the media.  The way such things become a trend is much more complicated than simply trying to make a documentary for it.  Applying minimalist aspects in life would be a healthy way of decreasing one's carbon footprint, but the amount of people that would partake in this ideology wouldn't be enough to make this more than a marginal dent in the climate crisis, which is why I still believe the only way we are going to help the climate crisis is through mandatory regulations.
<br><br><hr><br>
I see where you’re coming from. In a couple of comments, I’ve brought up how, from a low-income perspective, it’s tough to say “money doesn’t buy happiness”. It’s tough because how would we know? It’s hard to not associate money with happiness because we (and even the middle class) are often one paycheck away from losing everything, so we are constantly in a state of stress. Living in areas where the cost of living is high makes it hard to not fantasize about having a bunch of money that covers more than what you could ever need. However, I think the film does try to emphasize taking care of only what you need. People who live in tiny homes still have rent and bills, but if they lower their overall amount of materials, it may make life a little easier. Then again, as you said, there isn’t a set path for happiness. Some people find comfort in buying random things for themselves and that’s totally understandable.
<br><br>
I don’t think I necessarily disagree with anything in the film, but I do find it interesting that people who have decided to live a minimalist lifestyle are happier while those who have no choice but to live minimalistically are looked down upon. My mom will never understand why I want to “settle for less” and live in a small home or apartment instead of a big one because I came from a small apartment to begin with. Ryan talking about how he grew up and emphasizing that he didn’t want to go down a path that’s the same (being poor basically) really struck me because there are people who want to indulge and have a bunch of things because they didn’t grow up having that privilege. So yeah it’s DEFINITELY easier for some to let go of things than others. It just depends on how you grew up in my opinion. You have people who have always been spoiled so they stay spoiled but you also have people who grew up poor and have a bunch of materialistic items because they never had that as a child. I hope I’m making sense here. 
<br><br>
Because minimalism is good for the environment, I encourage it and am excited to be an adult that already knows how to live minimally. However, just as hard as you would find it to get rid of your iPhone and clothes, many people are not willing to just give up their stuff. I think it just says a lot about how we all view happiness in general

I think it is important that people watch, "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" for a number of reasons. Firstly, I think the film does a good job of using personal anecdotes and tying them into the idea of minimalism. For example, I resonated with Joshua's personal anecdote. Joshua referenced how his mother and divorce happened in the same year and while all of this was happening he found time to indulge in buying items for his new apartment that he really did not need. The film demonstrated how society seeks happiness by buying materialistic items, but this practice could only make you happy for so long. Another part of the film that I believe was important was when Shannon Whitehead, sustainable-apparel consultant, addressed the true philosophical definition of materialism, a movement in favor of living an ethical life based on compassion and  reason. Society often thinks of materialism as having a negative connotation. However, if we reassessed the true definition of materialism and found reason in material items, it could possibly change how society views a "wealthy" lifestyle. 
<br><br>
A problem I had with the film, rather than the concept of minimalism, is how the film could be seen as an advertisement in making minimalism the new "trend". I wanted them to go more into detail in addressing the fact that minimalism is not just a trend but a lifestyle that can be extremely beneficial to our environment. It is disheartening to think that one of the only reasons minimalism gained popularity in the past few years was because it was brought to light by people of privileged backgrounds. People of color and lower-income have been practicing minimalism for the longest time, however they will never be credited for it. I think it is important to address why minimalism.
<br><br>
Overall I think the film did a good job of defining what minimalism is and how it can be used to live a more sustainable and fulfilled life. I believe that minimalism could become a popular practice over time with enough exposure. However, I do not believe that a capitalist and individualistic society like ours can make the jump to minimalism.

I completely agree with your statement. The biggest takeaway statement that impacted me the most was at the very end when Joshua stated "Love people and use things, because the opposite never works". For me, that was the best way to describe or sum up what minimalism should be about. I used to think that minimalism was just a bunch of people trying to be different from everyone else, by proving that they could live with the least amount of things possible. For obvious reasons after this, whenever I thought of the concept of minimalism, I always pictured privileged people taking the most extreme measures to "live". You brought up a really interesting topic on how people of color and low-income societies often practice minimalism for livelihood rather than choice. Instantly, I thought of my childhood and how I grew up always having less than my friends and peers but never seeing it as minimalism; rather, it was just life, us getting by with what we could. I definitely agree that it must be discussed further of why it is that privileged people are constantly profiting off of the practices of minorities, and how these profits are affecting different societies and the potential it has in turn to affect the environment , if any. Despite that, I enjoyed much of the film pushed the idea that minimalism did not have to be as extreme as it is often perceived. We should allow ourselves to have enough clothes and things, but should not have too many to where we just always want more. More of everything in every possible version there is. I also highly doubt that such capitalistic societies such as ours will push for minimalism, however if potentially we could, it should not force people to feel like they have to survive of nothing, we should encourage living with only the necessities to have more time, more money, and more space to actually get to enjoy life.

This was outright one of the best movies I have ever watched for this class. I feel like this movie gave me additional insights on a different lifestyle polar opposite to mine, and made me critically think about how I could maybe improve my lifestyle in a way that would also help the Earth at the same time. One of the most interesting facts to me that was presented during the film was that in a normal household, only 40% of the space was used in a day by a normal family. To think that 60% of the floor space had not been used once by anyone in any given day puts into perspective how wasteful we really are when it comes to our living environments. 
<br><br>
To hear first person perspectives from people who went from the everyday nine to five jobs to living a life of happiness and minimalism was a refreshing change as well. I had always wondered what it would be like to ditch a stable and prosperous lifestyle in favor of a more riskier one to find true happiness. These perspectives made me think of the applications to my own life and how I might have to try out minimalism in the future.

After watching “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things", I figure out that this video really reflected how human constantly want to buy things or consume the things they like. And I begin to understand how serious it is that people have wasted or consumed the thins that they don’t really need. minimalism lifestyle means we should consume less and less. From my own perspective, it is a kind of self satisfaction. We should lower our desires and buy less the things that we don’t really need in order to be minimalism.

I agree with you completely. My thoughts are that it seem's that humans are quite literally going insane. Like the Alcoholics/Narcotics anonymous quote, misattributed to Einstein, "Insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results." The average American will often put restrictions on their happiness based on their material possessions, "when I get this, then I'll be happy." They get the thing, but they aren't as happy as they thought they would be, and they continue to place their happiness in materialism, knowing that it will leave them empty and unsatisfied. Same can be said for social media or body image problems. If we really get down to it, there are two reasons that humans don't really know what they want/are unhappy/anxious about it. One is that they already have it, and second is they don't really know themselves.
<br><br><hr><br>
This video definitely reflected how humans want to constantly buy things that they do not need. Ryan Nicodemous found himself in the same hole as many other people, he was not happy with his life and resided to buying stuff. He thought that by buying more and more stuff he would be happy however that was not the case instead he felt depressed felt as if his life was falling apart which led him to become financially unstable. 
<br><br>
Minimalism is a new style of living of consuming or buying stuff that are really only essential to you. By living a minimalistic lifestyle not only are you helping out the planet, but you are helping yourself. You are creating more time to do the things you love, to spend time with loved ones, and have a healthy lifestyle. I myself am guilty of buying thing that I do not need, or I am even influenced by celebrities to buy the latest clothes, shoes, and accessories. I can definitely lower the amount of articles of clothing I buy, buy less shoes and just buy less stuff in general. I think that becoming minimalistic people we can start to help the environment and reduce waste.

Visualizing A Plenitude Economy
<br><br>
I had already watched the documentary Minimalism, so I instead watched the two short videos, Visualizing A Plenitude Economy and The High Price of Materialism. I think what struck me most about the first video, Visualizing A Plenitude Economy, was the amount of facts and truth it spoke with. The 2008 financial collapse was one point they made that resonated with me the most. We as Americans had to go through that tough time of recession, meanwhile the rich wolves of wall street were able to capitalize on the failure of our economy. A loss of 8 million jobs and 44 million people on food stamps is horrific. I couldn’t even imagine the struggle that Americans were going through at the time. “We need to reduce ecological impacts and increase jobs.” Easy to say, but hard to put into action. I think post people would agree that these two things were to help the planet as well as help our economy and people. However, actually putting these ideas into action is much harder. Reducing the amount of days Americans work a week sounds like a great idea, and it doesn’t surprise me that countries like the Netherlands are able to put these ideas into practice. The problem is, the Netherlands have just 17 million people living in their country. That's less than half the amount of people that live in California alone. How can we get a country of around 327 million people to fall in line with a plan that reduces work time for Americans and throws out the fossil fuel industry?
<br><br>
Not only am I skeptical about this plan in the first video, but The High Price of Materialism goes over some ideas that I’m not sure would work. This isn’t to say that I don’t agree with the ideas behind these videos, because I do. The problem is changing the minds of millions and millions of Americans out there who don’t even believe in some of the problems going on in the world, for instance the climate crisis. Promoting intrinsic values and feeling less insecure are great, but they’re not tangibles, they’re feelings, which are a lot harder to measure than numbers. I agree that materialism has consumed the lives of people all around the world, not even just Americans. Turn to your smartphone, go on Instagram or any social media platform, what do you see? People following celebrities, wrappers, famous sports stars, who openly flaunt their wealth by showing off their new exotic cars or expensive clothing. For all the money some of these people have that they spend on material goods, I can express a high amount of doubt that they care about the world they live in at all, I mean why would they? They live in their own little world as it is. It is extremely disappointing to see these famous people who could be doing a lot more for their own community, and even the world around them, simply by promoting these intrinsic values discussed in the video. Instead of promoting what new car they got this week, why not spread the important messages, the ones that really matter?

The film introduces minimalism from the perspective of two minimalists who had been once pursuing materialism and consumerism as much as ordinary people such that they almost ignored what was important to them. They used to consider earning more money and owning more stuff as being successful as most of us do. However, they finally realized what they really want to take out of their life and start to practice the idea of minimalism. They reduce their stuff by throwing away things that are useless to them. 
<br><br>
 One prominent idea of minimalism is replacing McMansions with small houses. In large houses that typical Americans pursue, they only use about forty percent of the space, leading people to purchase more stuff to fill up the void. By reducing housing space, people eventually get to think about what they really care about and what they don’t. Moreover, space are fully utilized in this sort of houses by practicing foldable furniture. The overall quality of life won’t ever be affected by the small living space. 
<br><br>
 Nowadays, people are receiving hundreds of advertisements from everywhere every day such that their standard of success is almost told by propaganda from large enterprises. Some of them even aimed on children, conveying radical ideas such as violence. These ads starts to influence people at a very young age. People are nearly deprived of their rights to decide what they define as success. However, conceptions on things that do not add value to people’s life cannot really make them happy. The idea of minimalism is to get rid of distractions that are consumed unnecessarily. Once people are not disturbed by irrelevant things, they can finally focus on what they really want out of their own life.
</p><hr>


<p>
In response to the idea of minimalism, I think that it makes perfect sense psychologically. This is extremely evident as presented in the video as both men found themselves to be happier and less chained to the societal pressures of materialism. I believe it is true that today we live in such a fast paced society, based on the objects we can obtain, that it can be easy to deteriorate one's mental health. For all these reasons, that is why I believe the minimalism movement to mainly be one presented based on the psychological benefits rather than the outright environmental ones. Although I believe that the way in which developed society relies on many disposable and ephemeral goods rather disgusting, I just don't see the large companies that have developed into global enterprises simply halting their businesses because a small sliver of the population has decided to not consume their products anymore due to "psychological" reasons. In the end, it truly is the production companies that are manufacturing in unsustainable ways, and the consumers are just buying them. Unless the majority of the public starts to follow this minimalist idealism, I don't see any significant changes being brought about in regards to the environmental impact of consumerism. On a less pessimistic note however I think at the individual level it is extremely important to reduce your carbon footprint in any way you can, because little things really can add up to big differences. I believe my younger generation in specific is trying our best to navigate through the dichotomy of wanting the large houses and material success of our parents while simultaneously thinking with a more ecological conscience. It really comes down to the supply and demand for these fast fashion and disposable types of consumer goods.

After watching the documentary on minimalism for this week, I had a deeper and more thorough comprehension of the minimalist lifestyle, and I felt like that it very accurately addressed the issue of overconsumption in the modern society leading many people to feel trapped in the cycle of purchasing new products but never really feeling satisfied and happy. One part of the documentary that I remember really well was its take on the materialistic nature of the modern society that, take clothing as an example, fast fashion has completely dominated the clothing and fashion market which compels consumers to feel the need that they have to constantly buy new clothes in order to keep up with the current trend. The documentary mentioned how back in the days of our parents or grandparents, there were only four distinct seasons in a year following the natural cycle of the season, or sometimes only two seasons of hot and cold in a year that people only bought clothes to keep themselves warm or to prepare for the heat. Now, the modern fashion industry is promoting countless seasons in a year that there are new clothes out literally every day and the consumers have no choice but to buy those clothes to be fashionable. The reason that people throw old clothes away today is not that they cannot be worn anymore but because they are no longer fashionable according to the fast fashion trend. The popular consumerism in our modern society perpetuated with companies’ advertisements, fashion magazines, social media, and many other points of our contact with the social world is instilling the idea that the only way to achieve happiness and success is to buy more, better, more extravagant products that we don’t necessarily need. 
<br><br>
However, this is not true as shown by this documentary that new technology products and new fashionable clothing will not make us happy but will instead make us feel like we are trapped in an endless cycle of consumption of goods and that we are living in a life with no true meaning or purpose. Another point brought up during the documentary that I really resonated with is the main reason for the compulsory purchasing of many people in the hope to use those newly-purchased goods to fill up the empty void within ourselves and to make ourselves feel more complete and whole as human beings. Those goods might initially help us feel that way at the beginning, but gradually we will get tired and sick of them and we will need to buy newer, better products to fill that emptiness within ourselves, and this is how the companies’ marketing strategy to maximize the profits they can earn from the consumers. In the midst of this crazy consumption cycle, I think many of us have forgotten that this void, this emptiness within ourselves can never be filled up with new goods but with a sense of meaning, motivation, and purpose in our lives, the sense of liveliness and the happiness to be alive, the passion that we have for life and for the activities we enjoy in our lives, and the amount of quality time spent with family, friends, and loved ones. These things can never be equivalent to the consumption of new popular goods because they provide fundamentally different feelings and results to us human beings: the compulsive purchasing of new goods is merely a form of stimulation that can only bring us a limited period of ecstasy and excitement, which is in a way incredulously similar to the usage of recreational drugs, while a sense of purpose, meaning, and significance in life is what essentially makes us complete and human because we know our positions in this world and the positive changes and differences that we are able to bring to this society. The documentary summarizes all of this up very well: we are materialistic in that we are consuming and buying new products just for the sake of buying them and we are not materialistic in that we care less about the essence and the true materials that construct our lives such as our sense of meaning and purpose in our lives. 
<br><br>
Now to the question of whether minimalism is beneficial to the environment that Ken asked in the film video, I believe that minimalism is a very good initial step to addressing the climate crisis because the central concept of minimalism is to only purchase the things that are necessary and use those things to a maximum extent while cherishing and loving your loved ones and the relationships you have. The following of minimalism can effectively reduce our carbon footprint on the planet because we do not need to purchase so many unnecessary products, thus reducing the carbon emission and the use of fossil fuels and other natural resources in order to manufacture the products we purchase. In my opinion, minimalism is such a perfect win-win situation because it declutters your life by removing the extra distractions in your life helping you become more focused and helps you find the significance and the sense of purpose in your life while contributing to the greater positive cause of climate change through reducing our carbon footprints on the environment.

The film, "Minimalism: a Documentary About the Important Things," was honestly something I would never choose to watch myself for my own pleasure, but I am definitely glad it was assigned because its a great film that many people in today's society should watch. Our society has been consumed by a corrupt perspective on success, accomplishments, happiness, and the American dream that just continues to get more and more intense every year. Many mentalities get more and more materialistic by the day, but in the incorrect manner of materialistic not focusing on what truly brings value to their lives. I have to admit, I have definitely been part of that population with the negative materialistic mindset, striving for a future made up by a materialistic luxurious lifestyle, but after watching this documentary I sure hope and plan to make an effort to shift onto the right form of materialism, although I do not plan on becoming a full on minimalist. Becoming a top of the line, ideal minimalist would definitely be a dramatic and difficult change in people's lives, so many would not be willing to take on that challenge for a realistically better way of living. That doesn't mean that people wouldn't make an effort in at least altering their lifestyles little by little, by changing even just little things in their everyday lives. I believe society would be more open to the idea once they realize how effective and beneficial minimalist habits really are. The more people that make the change will cause even more people to want to work towards it. It most definitely would be better for both us and the planet as it can help with depression, anxiety, unhealthy competition, social unfairness, etc, along with decreasing our carbon footprint in many ways.

I too had a very positive experience watching the film. I've always admired the minimalist movement, and specifically the simplicity and aesthetic appeal of the tiny house movement. However, I'd never truly considered it as a way of life I could practice until I watched this movie. But after having watched this movie, not only do I feel like this lifestyle is doable, but I believe it could enhance my life as a whole.
<br><br>
I don't expect everyone to become a "full on minimalist" but I think most people could benefit from adopting some minimalist attitudes. Like most things, the degree to which a person undertakes a minimalist lifestyle is on a spectrum. Not everyone will be able to part with the many things and products they've amassed throughout their life, but we all have to try. Furthermore, we should be challenging ourselves and the people around us to only purchase and consume things with real value to our lives.
<br><br>
I think the biggest obstacle working against more people adopting a minimalist lifestyle is the constant consumer reinforcement from advertising and media. There will have to be a critical change in how we as a country shop and our relationship with the products we buy.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you that this film isn’t one that I would choose by myself. However, This film really opened my eyes to some of the things I have been practicing in my life that weren’t the best for me or the earth. Like many others, I really enjoy buying clothing, especially when it is so easy and cheap. If I’m feeling stressed, ill go shopping because it seems to bring me joy. However, after watching this film, I realize it isn’t real happiness. The film highlights the idea of using these consumer product to fill a void within ourselves. When you actually step back and reexamine it, its true. Advertisers and businesses have made consumerism our new normal. As the documentary notes, advertisements are even starting to target children and implement the need for consumption into them at a young age and we are allowing it because its our normal too. Having these superficial attachments to items is extremely toxic. Our human identity is now defined by the things we buy. Every single person in the film who talked about their experiences of minimizing seemed extremely happy and content with their lives. It seemed after they got rid of the useless items there was a burden that fell off of their shoulders. I like the idea of a tiny home/tiny apartment and would definitely implement something like that into my life. Before watching this film, I thought minimalism was a radical change where you just threw everything away. However, that’s not the case. Minimalism just encourages you to get rid of possessions that don’t bring you joy or have a purpose in your life. Even just using projects like project 333, where you only use 33 items from your closet for 3 months. It’s not only a cleansing of your life but also of your mind. People also found clarity of their mind in meditation, what seems to be a common theme in a lot of these films. Minimizing our lives might be one of the hardest steps we have to take not only to minimize our carbon footprint, but also to live a better life. We shouldn’t put importance on inanimate objects but on things like family and loved ones, even pets. It a whole change in mindset, identity, and culture

Currently, people usually buy things to satisfy their inner emptiness. When people buy things, they don not think about whether this thing is what they need. And people usually do not have a limit on what they buy. In fact, such a large amount of consumption is traceable. On social media such as Facebook, bloggers post their quality of life which are making people feel that life is the standard of good life. Excessive advertising can also make people buy too much. They wan to gain happiness through consumption. But is the happiness improved? In fact, some studies have shown that when the annual income is less than $70,000, the purchase does increase a certain sense of well-being. But for people with high incomes, consumption is not enough to meet their requirements for good life. For example, an executive who used to work in a bank, although his income is really high, but the work has occupied most of his life. He did not have the adventurous spirit of pursuing his dreams. So at this time minimalism is necessary. Minimalism supports people to buy only what they need. For example, living in a small space. When people don't have as much space to store, they think about what is really important and how people should live. Then a lot of consumption will not appear. In the movie, meditation is also a way to help people restrain consumption.
<br><br>
Although this film seems to have nothing about the environment, minimalism has a great effect on environmental protection. Excessive consumption is often accompanied by excessive production. The production of these daily necessities, such as clothes, furniture,and so on, consumes large amounts of natural energy source such as coal. If minimalism is implemented, it will greatly reduce the consumption of natural resources and reduce the carbon dioxide and sewage emitted when these products are re-produced. The negative impact on the environment will be greatly reduced. For example, in the 333 project, people only use 33 items to complete the three-month wear. If more and more people follow suit, the impact of fast fashion on people will be lower and lower, and the consumption of clothes will be less and less. As seen in true cost, the sewage produced by clothes can pollute the river. Clothes are also one of the major industries for carbon emissions. I believe that if more and more people implement minimalism, it will alleviate my global warming. I hope to recommend this movie to my friends. The film is a good way to advertise to the audience what minimalism is. I hope that my friends can also implement minimalism. You can regulate your own desires and contribute to the environment.

Minimalism is to pursue the least requires of life with fulfilling the basic needs in life. However, contracted with minimalism, consumerism is more popular now. It is getting harder for people to get satisfied. Also, social media also attracts people to shop for the products that they do not really need. More products do not mean a better life. Personally, I hope everyone can find the most suitable ways for themselves to live.

This film “Minimalism” introduces the concept of minimalism and the minimal lifestyle by presenting some real-life examples. In the beginning, the question concerned by Ryan Nicodemus is pretty meaningful. He said there is a feeling of the gaping void in his life, and he tried to fill out this void with a lot of stuff, mainly the consumer purchases.  I think most of the people have the same problem, so they live for the paycheck and stuff. The reason why people fill their void with purchases is, as the film said, that human desire is unlimited. However, as Nicodemus asserted, we are not living at all. Therefore, the minimalism shows up as the method and new living style to cure our void. Based on the film, minimalism is asking if the stuff has value in our lives, if not, we have to willing to let go.  And there are some examples of minimalism, one simplifies life and move to a small apartment. The most attractive example for me is the life edited one. They maximize the utility of the apartment is very limited space, and I would love to live in such an apartment because of the brilliant design. In addition, the point about the advertisement and social media is realistic to me. These social media are like the catalyst attracting people to purchase even something useless to them. In my opinion, it is hard for everyone to totally become minimalism, since the desire is a human instinct, but we should apply minimalism to balance our desire, making our buying rational.

I completely agree that humans seem to have an endless desire for "stuff."  I do agree that this is just part of our nature, but as you state that a lot of it is due to social media. I think that as stated in the movie, advertisements, social media, television and other commercial outlets have a huge impact upon humans and our spending and consuming habits.  For example, the fast fashion industry, I was fascinated to find that there are 52 SEASONS??? the industry is so concerned with making money, that they need you customers to feel as if something they bought 7 days previously is now "out of style."  As also stated in the film, I think a lot of the desires come from this concept of the American Dream.  People feel fulfilled as they are able to purchase anything they can think of.  What is the point of working if you have nothing to show for it?  
<br><br>
I was also very impressed with the life edited space, and how they really make complete use out of the amount of space which they have.  It inspired me to think about how I could do things like that with the amount of space that I live within.  However, I do agree with you that the entire population will very unlikely ever reach a minimalistic lifestyle, there are things that we can all do to take small steps to reach that.  For example, I was thinking, becoming minimalist at this point is really not about getting rid of what you DO have, but not buying more unnecessary things.  Things you have already purchased are already contributing to your footprint, and will still eventually end up in the landfill after you get rid of them.  However, if you can make the things you do have last longer, and not purchase as much from now on, it could make a big difference.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you talking about how it is hard for people to become fully minimalist. I think for us to work in the real world, we all want something that can be shown for it in a materialistic way. I worked hard to build a computer that I could play video games with, but how badly do I actually need something like an expensive computer to do that? I also agree that people will live for that paycheck that will bring them their next item of momentary happiness, and things in our lives like media praise that type of work ethic. I have a sibling who has bought toothbrushes from snap chat adds, an item that was oversold in the idea of it which was unnecessary to buy. Minimalism should be what keeps us grounded for the true things we need and want in life. I do not think it is possible for everyone to become a minimalist, but it is worth a try to help create a more humanistic way to find meanings of life. The film makes a good point of talking about how our human desire is unlimited. I agree with this but its the way that we deal with this unlimited desire is how we will be able to create a more meaningful life. If we have a few items, we should expand on what its original state is, rather than trying to upgrade to the next best thing of it to not waste the original potential that the item had.
<br><br><hr><br>
It's pretty odd to think that the things we strive to achieve happiness, are in itself, the reason we can't achieve happiness. So much of our self-indulgence is the aftermath of the material culture/ world that we are raised in. Just earlier today, I was stressing out because the video game I was playing. It's an odd way to look at it, but the fact that I proceed to play something that adds so much anxiety to my life is so counter-intuitive . This is something that is supposed to bring me joy so why am I so caught up with it? I feel like a lack of clutter and material objects can be so stress-relieving as there's simply less things to worry about. Instead of thinking about something like your video games, you can think about the things that matter(relationships, health, etc). I have so much respect for Josh and Ryan because they managed to cut all the excess out of their lives in a society that puts an excessive amount of emphasis on consumerism. I agree that the maximization of the utility of their apartment was extremely captivating to me. Also, it isn't as if they're pushing their beliefs onto others. One of them even admits his wife wouldn't consider herself a minimalist. The key concern is the well-being of others and I genuinely appreciate that.
<br><br><hr><br>
I enjoyed reading your comment. This may sound silly but I have tried to piece together how my desires have changed since I have arrived at college and I would always say how it is hard to desire what has never been exposed to us. It’s almost as if we were programmed(at a lower income level) to only want new things and to spend our last dollars on something that will not benefit us in the long run. This does not take away from the fact that wealthy and middle class folks also splurge on expensive items. I just believe  that there must be more awareness of the void you described and how people stick to filling this void because human desire is unlimited. 
<br><br>
Even though I am a college student, I have way more money for material items and luxury products in comparison to when I was younger and my mom provided for me. But although I have the means to purchase more, I have less desire to do so. I remember growing up and wishing for new clothes and new shoes nearly everyday because I didn’t have much.  All of my friends and I grew up in  huge households with even smaller houses. Many of our families did not have cars and struggled with keeping the lights on and figuring out what our next meals would be. Our eyes lit up when we saw new clothes and shoes. I always loved watching shows on HGTV in order to see the exquisite properties and dreamed of which one I would be buying or building one day. Relative deprivation increases the human desire for material possessions. It does not drive us to fight for an equal distribution of wealth, but instead it leads us to working hard in order to achieve these items. We constantly are told of how hard work and determination leads to success, so we believe that these possessions are achievable so that it was many of us do, we fight for them. 
<br><br>
You made an important point about minimalism and how it involves self realization, asking ourselves if the items in our lives have value and to let them go, if not. These items have value to a lot of people because they worked and spent most of what they earned to achieve these things. I’m speaking off of my own experience and also those next to me but there has to be a shift of finding happiness in these items because we often lose interest in them shortly after purchasing.

What is happiness? Is it the pursuit of everything we desire in life or the pursuit of what we truly hold valuable? As humans, we are constantly trying to thrive in life, thinking that our thirst for happiness could ever be satisfied by simply earning bigger salaries and buying stuff that we “need.” We live in society that uses people and loves things because this is what we’ve been taught to do. Society has imposed on us a reality, a path that we all should follow in order to achieve “happiness.” The same way drugs turn us into addicts, consumerism has done the same thing. We are all suffering from a material addiction that can never be satisfied. The closer we are to achieve our economic goals, we set newer and more ambitious ones because we feel that what we have is not enough. And instead of filling the void we have, it makes us more miserable; thus, inducing us in a never-ending cycle of consumption. A cycle that leads to an unhappy life.
<br><br>
 Have you ever wondered why sometimes those who have “everything” are not satisfied with their lives while those who have what’s “necessary” are happy with life? Those who have climbed the ladder of success have done it for a terrible price. They have become detached to what really matters: family. They have given everything that once was a source of happiness just to achieve a respectable social status. Yes, they have the money and life they want, but at what cost? The idea of shifting from consumerism to minimalism is truly an eye-opening strategy that has shown that happiness can be achieve with what is only essential to our lives. Imagine a life where you only have what is necessary to survive and live comfortably: a small but well-distributed home, enough accessories, enough utilities. All this reduction in our lives decreases our financial burden, the necessity to kill ourselves over work and afford just what we need which ultimately leads to happiness. 
<br><br>
 Becoming a minimalist is not an easy task. It requires a deep understanding of what is most valuable and best for us. To live a life in which we only have what we need over what actually want. I have been victim of “The American dream.” I have been deceived by society and all the marketing in our world to live a life that only increases my internal void. Instead of pursuing “the American Dream,” we should follow “an American Dream.” What I mean is that we should stop following what is hold to be truth and ideal, and pursuit what truly makes us happy. We should create our own happiness and have our life revolve around that idea. We need to stop being envious of what our neighbors have and rather be grateful for what we have. Our life on this earth is short, and it could end any second. Therefore, we should enjoy it at the best of our abilities and capabilities because once we are gone, no one will remember us for what we did, but rather for how we lived our life. In order to pursuit a meaningful life, we have to become a whole person; a person ready to sacrifice the things we want and retain the things that are really important. As former President Jimmy Carter said, “Consuming doesn’t satisfy our longing for meaning”, but rather decreases it. 
<br><br>
I just want to end this by saying that we should re-consider our priorities in life now that we are young. Do you want a life where you are successful but unhappy? Or a life where you establish meaningful relationships with those who you love? To me, success is this and nothing more. Let’s live a life free of addictions and burdens. Let’s live a minimalistic life where we choose those things important to us and throw away all the excess, and noise around us.

you made some really great points here. I definitely can see how consumerism can be compared to drug addiction. At this point there are so many people who have fallen into the bad habit of accumulating materialistic things as opposed to meaningful and valuable things that actually promote happiness. I definitely agree with your point that a lot of people have lost sight of what is important in life. Too many people believe money is everything because of the fungibility of it, but in reality money cant go beyond the level of material happiness and utility. Whereas emotional happiness requires non materialistic things like people you love/family. I really liked reading your comment and I totally agree with your points!

<br><br><hr><br>
Thanks for your insight!  I really appreciate reading everyone’s comments because it makes me thing about ideas I hadn’t considered before. To what you said though, I do agree that society has become far less minimalist. They tend to acquire things that they don’t need which in exchange provides a void that cannot be filled
<br><br><hr><br>
I really like everything you’ve said here, the part about “successful” people sacrificing family and friendships to achieve monetary and social status resonated with me. I thought about all the media that points us to materialism; shows like “Shark Tank” and inspirational quotes saying “sometimes you have to give up everything you love for success” are all around us. At the base of our culture, we are made to think that giving up family or friends to pursue entrepreneurship is somehow brave or important. What an absolutely sad thought. The phrase used by many rappers and social icons is “it’s lonely at the top,” and thinking about that now, how true that must be. To reach the high social and economic status that these people have, they have truly given up very important parts of human happiness. All we need are the things that are necessary for a safe life, everything on top of that is a modern invention.
<br><br>
The pressure to conform to a success culture is huge, it’s been perpetuated by the media for a few hundred years. We hear phrases like “children should be more successful than their parents,” but what is success? Yes, typically future generations have had more social mobility, more economic success, but mental health has been on a huge decline, heart disease and obesity-related health problems (in America) are perpetually on the rise. People are significantly less happy from all social markers, yet GDP is high and our unemployment is relatively low. We need to fundamentally change how we view the very concept of success; if we don’t shift towards minimalism and family-based happiness, we are only going to sink into deeper depression.

<br><br><hr><br>
I really like here how you compared our consumeristic culture to a drug addiction as I feel it is all too true not just in the amount that we are addicted but the terrible consequences of this addiction as well. Drug addicts put their bodies through hell as they continue on their path, and we are doing the same thing to the planet. Everyday we see these poor side affects that our culture has caused, and even still we continue with our addiction. We can only hope that eventually we see this for all that it is rather than glorifying it, and that it isn’t too late by the time that we do.
<br><br><hr><br>
This was a really well-written comment and I think you've described the essence of minimalism beautifully. The documentary also made me think about my life choices, which I often do from daily observations on a regular basis. Unfortunately many of us have already subscribed to the endless supply of consumerism and not only do they struggle to live happily, they are also putting a huge burden on our planet earth by forcing it to "digest" all the waste they generate. Change can be effectuated, however; if we start believing in the simplistic beauty of minimal happiness , and pass that spirit forward, we can possibly convince more around us.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree with what you had to say, "The American Dream" has been misconstrued and perverted into benefiting capitalism by encouraging consumerism by overconsumption and society telling you that it will make you happy. True happiness cannot be bought, minimalism is a great solution to reduce consumption and to make people actually realize what the things in life are that bring actual happiness. When I think about the happiest moments of my life I don't think about the $180 pair of sneakers I bought when I was 16 because I thought that I would make me happy, I think about the people who care about me and the impact I have on their lives and their impact on mine. It is sad that there are so many people who are caught up in this consumerist mindset and are enslaved into buying things they do not need while the planet suffers because of it. It is much better to live a life full of meaningful connections and relationships than a life of capitalistic greed.
<br><br><hr><br>
“Minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem”. The rates we use and abuse meaningless things in our life is catastrophic. While minimalism may not be a direct environmental film with facts about rising sea level, carbon dioxide emissions, or dying coral reefs the minimalist lifestyle is an important aspect to the changes in the environment that we need to make. By having less you pollute the planet less, plain and simple. Minimalism not only positively affects the environment but it also positively impacts your mind. It’s basically a win win. When you have less you focus on only the things that make you happy and not the “stuff” that is overwhelming and irrelevant. Minimalism is an extremely important concept. Although I don't follow it as strictly as some do in the film I find it rewarding to get rid of meaningless things to live a more meaningful life. This reminds me of Walden and the importance of a simple lifestyle. This brings me to your point of how much humans crave happiness, even if they already have everything. No matter how many items we have to our name it will never fill a holes we have or be an answer to mental health. I agree with you, our concept of value is so skewed we may never be happy or even begin to fully understand what Minimalism is or how to make that change. We have been trained to want things in our life to give us value. I hope we our generation can try to rise above the addictions and burdens we put on ourselves. We still have time but whether or not we choose to live a truly happy life is the real question.
<br><br><hr><br>
You mentioned mainly great point in your comment and I really enjoyed reading your take on success and a happy life is for you. For the most part I do agree with you in the sense that we should revaluate ourselves and our goals, and truly try to determine the happy life that we want. like you mentioned I agree that most of us do fall into the idea of "the American dream" and we relate it to having mainly things and being very consumeristic. I feel that each person has a different meaning to what makes them happy, its up to each person individually to decide what that it. The ability to really evaluate yourself and find what makes you happy or content is very hard today, because you are constantly bombarded by all type of ideals and people trying to tell you what you need and how you should live your life. Most of the time those persons are not looking out for your benefit but for their own. Those same people, are desperately trying to seek that "American dream" and fill that void that you mentioned, that society has placed in our heads that we have. I think it is very important to try and slow down and focus on relationships that are productive, beneficial, and that make you more happier. Of course, this is not such an easy task since society as whole has to fight this capitalistic mentality and come to their own conclusion of  focusing on what really makes of us happy.

Watching Minimalism gave me a new found perspective on life. It was amazing to see how Joshua and Ryan found a new purpose to life that brought them happiness and peace. We clearly see that people across the US are interested in this idea as each show they go to attracts more and more people. Not only are people here to listen, they are engaged such as the man in Las Vegas engaging with them to end this wolf of Wall Street idea that many Americans have. Seeing the documentary provided us with many examples of people being happy in their minimalistic lifestyle, such as living in the small house, and doing the 3 for 33 challenge. I believe this documentary therefore did a great job at breaking the notion of American ideals. I believe that many Americans, such as the ones that attended Joshua and Ryan's talks, want to live a minimalistic life, however, the social attitude we have towards it now causes fear in many that living this life would bring lack of fulfillment and happiness. This documentary breaks that notion by not only showing how many people found new found happiness in their new minimal life but also how the "American way" of living currently has brought many people unhappiness and a lack of fulfillment. Their prospective has definitely widened my view, as it has been a goal of mine to spend less money on materialistic items but rather spend it on experiences I will remember forever. At the same time, I hope to adopt some ways of the minimalistic style in the near future, to not only bring happiness to myself but to live a more sustainable life for the planet.

On a side note,  something that stood out to me right away was the scene towards the end talking about companies targeting kids. This immediately brought me back to what Ken talks about in lecture of politicians urging K-12 teachers to promote teachings against climate change. What we've been doing to our youth and this culture that we have established that it is okay to target and in a sense "brainwash" them is crazy. The people who are supposed to be innovators and leaders of our country are instead committing their efforts to taking advantage of kids in order to support their big business ventures and that in itself is tragic.

I've always appreciated the minimalist aesthetic because I have difficulty focusing in the presence of too much stimuli and distractions. Growing up in a cluttered house, I picked up a habit of maintaining order in my spaces as best I could. However, I noticed one day that no matter how much I cleaned, my room still felt "stuffy" for lack of a better word. Watching Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" cemented what I learned from observing my own lifestyle: I simply had too much stuff. I enjoyed the film because it showed the reality of a minimalist lifestyle and proved that it was doable and that it is beneficial to more than just the environment.

thank you for the inisghtful comment on the documentary. I agree with the points you have brought up in your comment. I too agree that focusing the presence of much stimuli is rather distracting. My room too feels "stuffy" at times due to an overabundance of ... stuff. Here's to hoping we can remedy this problem
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely see where you are coming from. I too have a really cluttered room in my house, and try to maintain order in it. This is a unique room in that it is filled with live animal enclosures and aquariums. I have always tried to balance the number of species in this room. I wanted a tarantula collection, for example, but would having too many different species of tarantulas distract me from appreciating each individual species? I definitely did not end up maintaining a minimalist collection, having kept many species of tarantulas in my room. This feels like a far fetched analogy to the film we watched, but I really felt like I needed these tarantulas, just like you, Tesia, felt like you needed your stuff. I have found that over the years, rather than observing many animals casually, it pays off to intensely observe and appreciate the beauty of one animal. It seems like you also figured this out by trying to maintain order in your space - realizing how it provided you with an environment where you could focus on certain things instead of being distracted by many different stimuli.
<br><br><hr><br>
Interesting take on this issue. I am surprised to see a connection like the one you made to your tarantulas. I wish you the best of luck with your organismal adventures.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree, in my own personal life I find that I have too many things. But wouldn't throwing out what you already own have a negative effect? I find that my clutter is not something that is built up overnight but rather over years. I still have the shoes I used from seventh grade.  After all, Rome wasn't built in a day. It is important to learn from this experience and strive to be more fiscally and environmentally conservative.
<br><br><hr><br>

You bring up a good point about how throwing things away can contribute a negative effect. Perhaps recycling/donating/composting the material obtained in the past, and a lessening of obtaining future objects.

<br><br><hr><br>
aside from my collection of unique arthropods, I also have other "clutter" that I have had since sixth grade or so. I cannot bear to throw these out. They simply mean too much to me to be discarded. Rather than throwing things away, I think a way to mitigate this negative effect would be to redistribute your belongings and reorganize them.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree but as I previously mentioned our desire to collect is a very human one. I don't enjoy dampening the sides of us that make us human but for the planet, I believe we must simply stop acquiring goods and just save. This is both financially and environmentally responsible.
<br><br><hr><br>
Within the documentary,  "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," multiple points were brought up regarding the detriments of social media use. In my opinion, social media has become one of the leading forms of stimuli/distractions of my generation. From shortened attention spans to obsessions with unattainable standards, social media has created an unrealistic portrayal of life that supports affluence, dissatisfaction, and wasteful living. I mean what social media influencer have you seen that doesn't constantly update their closet, drive a Jeep, Range Rover, or G-Wagon or live in a mansion? 
<br><br>
Social media perpetuates the idea that more money equals increased happiness when in fact, the opposite is true. As mentioned in the documentary, once you earn over $70,000 per year (enough to pay for the basic necessities: food, security, shelter) happiness tends to cap out. However, a lot of the current "flex" culture popular on social media, which involves showing off every expensive trip, outfit, and dinner to keep up with the latest trends or celebrities only increases consumerism.  Although,  I do recognize that certain trends of minimalism, such as thrift or vintage shopping for furniture, clothes, and accessories, have become popularized in recent years by certain social media influencers. Hopefully, as people become aware of the climate crisis and environmental degradation caused by affluence and consumerism, more will be willing to make compromises such as wearing clothes longer or cutting down on unnecessary purchases.
<br><br><hr><br>
I couldn’t agree with you more. Growing up as a huge sneaker-and-clothing fan, I kept purchasing different sneakers and clothes to fulfill my life if I got any extra money in my own pocket. I once despised myself when I was having trouble with the choice of shoes because I thought I was a bad person who caused a waste of money and resources. However, that was just a moment and faded away. It’s been so long that I’ve never tried to change my behavior even if I knew it wasn’t a good thing. After watching “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things”, it truly helps me understand the lifestyle of minimalism in full details and what it means to our society. The main idea runs through the whole film: consuming less. And I learned that applying minimalism to our daily life is just an effective way to reduce our carbon footprints and further mitigate the climate crisis happening right now. Watching this documentary and reading Thoreau’s Walden simultaneously is just a perfect match for a person like me to evaluate my lifestyle and make changes to it.
<br><br><hr><br>
I too have always appreciated the minimalist aesthetic because of the cluttered house I lived in growing up, which felt very overwhelming at times and still does when I go home. Regarding your comment about cleaning your room and it still feeling stuffy, I feel the exact same way! Whenever I clean my room it really feels like I’m just straightening out the clutter so that it looks nice rather than getting rid of it. This is something that I would love to change, but I hold sentimental value to a lot of unnecessary items like art projects I made when I was younger and merch from bands I used to listen to that I never wear. I think my biggest problem that is holding me back from minimalism is my love for clothes and a fear that I won’t have enough options if I cut down. I know this isn’t true but hey, it still holds me back. While I’m not fully ready to commit or even begin to commit to a lifestyle of minimalism, this documentary made me see just how beneficial it can be not only to the environment, but to our personal livelihoods as well.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree with you. I think the more stuff you have, the more you have to worry and stress about. I can see why, Joshua and Ryan stated in the film that after switching to a minimalist lifestyle, they were much much happier in various aspects of life. I think with the less junk you have, the more you can appreciate the few key necessities in your life. I agree with you that it can feel very “stuffy” at times when you just have so much stuff that you don’t even need but still have. I have so much stuff and I continue to buy more thinking I might “need it one day”, but after watching this film I have decided I should stop buying more than what I truly need. Not only will this benefit my own well-being but it will also help the environment.
<br><br><hr><br>
I have exactly the same situation with you. I also have trouble with throwing away old stuffs since I think each item I own contains my memory. However, minimalism is a perfect solution for this problem because it limits the number of stuff I have from beginning. Compare to Joshua and Ryan, authors of Minimalism, I just simply have too many stuffs. In the film, there is a challenge called “Project 33”, which I’m willing to take a try. I would like to see if I could really survive for 3 month with only 33 pieces of clothes, including accessories and shoes. By cutting my clothes to 33, I take my first step towards minimalism.
<br><br><hr><br>
Honestly, in my attempts it has been hard for me to live a minimalist lifestyle. I have no love for money or material wealth, but I can't help seeing some clothing item or something of the sort and desiring to own it. The people around me know of my liking for clothes and shoes as much as I do. However, I am coming to the realization that this means nothing in this fleeting life. While I know that such things do not equate to happiness as I have many intrinsic values and structures in my life that make me truly happy, I still struggle combating my temptations to own that fashionable new piece. Since coming to college, I have been much better at really gauging what i need, not what I would like the have since there is only limited space, and this has had a positive effect on how much clothes, food, and miscellaneous that I buy. I think we should all attempt to adopt a minimalist lifestyle to the best of our ability as it will not only serve the environment, but it will also benefit us on a personal level.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really like what you had to say. I too have always found an appreciation for the minimalist aesthetic. I completely relate to not being able to focus with distractions. I often find myself cleaning my room if I feel stressed and after cleaning, I feel so much better. I have recently noticed after cleaning my room and trying to clear off things from my desk that its really difficult because I feel that I need all these things around me at all times to have easy access. I think that this lifestyle in the terms of clothing could be simple for me because I have a tendency to wear outfits that look very similar and would be so unnecessary for me to have so much clothing if I look close to the same every single day.
<br><br><hr><br>
You're absolutely right, minimalism is a simple idea that should help with your difficulty of focusing on too many things at once. I also notice how many things I have and stuff I own. It makes me feel kind of overwhelmed at times that I can keep up with having and keeping track of so much stuff at once. This was the most fascinating movie we have watched so far because it brought up several intriguing issues that we cannot avoid amidst an environmental crisis. Minimalism is a good way to help with your mental health because you would be more conscious, aware, and relieved of everything.

One big thing that bothers me about the economy is the government’s seeming reliance on Reaganomics in the last 40 years, which is unironically called “trickle down economics” (which perfectly sums up my issue with it. I’m not anything near an economics major so I’m not going to say whether or not the system actually works as an economic model, but ever since the US became so reliant on this model, wealth wealth inequality has massively soared. In addition because it was seen as important that the rich have the opportunity to get all the money they need to pump back into the economy, it has allowed some pretty greedy and manipulative things to happen. Like the 2008 bank failure for example. This system is what has caused the 25 million people the video mentioned to not be able to find permanent jobs (that being about 7% of America's population). This all just is unacceptable and bothers me to no end.
<br><br>
So as improving Artificial Intelligence threatens to make the current economic model obsolete (which I suggest everybody to look into for their future), it is important that he we look forward to that serves the people rather than how it currently is that being the other way around. While I don’t immediately understand and are a little skeptical of whether not working would actually make people consume less (which is probably a consequence of this only being a 5 minute video) I am definitely all for the other points the video makes for a Pentitude Economy. Allowing Americans to work less is definitely necessarily given how the average has increased 200 hours per year in the last 50 years, and the proposal to actually just fire 5 people instead of 4 and to make everyone work 4 days a week is a great solution to our overworking, both solving the dwindling amount of jobs and people being overworked. In addition people getting more time for DIY would be a wonderful thing, and I know personally that I would want to improve a few of my practical skills in areas other than school if I had more free time.

After the more depressing films and readings of the last few weeks that highlighted the coming problems, it was nice to see a solution presented in the form of "Minimalism: A Documentary About Important Things." And even though minimalism is not an environmentally centered movement (and the environment is only mentioned once in the hour film), it will help us to cut down on our emissions. I like that the film was able to bring personal gain as a positive consequence of minimalism. Some people might not care about the environment (although I cannot fathom why), but they definitely do care about themselves and would want to see themselves be happier.
<br><br>
Another aspect of the film that I liked was that Josh and Ryan intercut their own story with the stories of other individuals that had started to practice minimalism in their lives. It was cool to see all of these success stories. Most importantly, they used a variety of examples, showing a single individual living in a small house, to a couple with 2 children, and also a family of 8 (6 children, 2 parents). This broad range of family sizes that were all able to successfully integrate a minimalist lifestyle shows it is not hard. There are no excuses, all you have to do is try it.
<br><br>
A few years ago my family and I did a deep clean of the house and decided to get rid of a lot of the stuff that had piled up over the years of us living in our house. There were a ton of books that I no longer read, a lot of board games that hadn't been played in a long time, and toys that hadn't been touched in years. After going through all of the stuff and donating those items, the house looked so much different. But in a good way. There was so much space and I barely even worried about the stuff that no longer occupied these empty areas. This is something that I would recommend to others because not only do you clear up a lot of space, but you are able to give the things you don't need to people that just might need it.

I really enjoyed the documentary Minimalism, it was very enjoyable to watch and not as much as a depressing undertone of the other films we have watched this year. Instead of just educating about the climate crisis, and consumerism, but also shows tips and ways for the audience to practice minimalism within their own lives. It makes minimalism not seem scary and doable. As someone who cares for the environment as much as me, it made me consider trying a minimalist lifestyle. The documentary goes into the description of minimalism and the stories of people who have decided to live this lifestyle. I have always dreamed of living in a tiny house. The story of the man that resides in one was very interesting. This showed me how doable living in such a small place, and not living this crazy consumerism lifestyle that is ingrained into our heads. And there are such beneficial environmental impacts that come from living a minimalist lifestyle. People in today's world, buy a lot of stuff and throw away a lot of stuff, by living this environmentally friendly minimalist lifestyle one could lower their carbon footprint immensely. This documentary makes this lifestyle attainable for the average human, and how easy it can actually be, which surprised me and was a very good tactic the directors used.

“Minimalism” was very effective at communicating its subject as it was a very well put together film that brought many authors, credible sources, and first person accounts to talk about the idea of how minimalism is beneficial in a society that is so material focused yet. The film’s audience was aimed at all Americans because we are all in a society that believes to find happiness you have to have the largest salary and most possessions but in reality that often leads to emptiness which leads to buying more material things to try and fill the void. My general reaction to the film was I agreed completely that living minimalist is beneficial and in my own life that is what I did when I moved to college because I cut back on everything I brought and learned to live with less. So my reaction was emotional because it reminds me of my move from Oregon to California. 
<br><br>
I learned about new techniques on how to live a life more minimalist, for example I learned about project 33 which is cutting your closet to only having thirty-three items and to take a break in this crazy world through the use of meditation. This film got my optimist about how in my future I can strive to live for this lifestyle. Yes I would definitely recommend this film as Josh and Ryan show you ways to find happiness and save money.

It is admirable how you have implemented the minimalist lifestyle into your own life and how you briefly spoke about your experiences as a minimalist. I think that the perfect time to cut down on the amount of stuff someone owns is when they are moving to college because the rooms are somewhat small plus you are sharing the area without one or two people. Plus by having less stuff, life, in general, feels less cluttered and more organized, thus giving you peace of mind to focus on other more important things. I will say that I am guilty of staring into my closet looking at my clothes I can wear yet it takes me half-an-hour to choose something, thus I agree that by cutting down on the number of clothing items one has in their clothes the decision process goes by easier and maybe the process becomes exciting.

<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with you, the film made me eager to try to cut my closet down to 33 items. When I moved to college I had a different experience than him, I realized I brought way to much stuff. I felt like my drawers and closet were constantly over flowing and unorganized. After Thanksgiving break I was able to bring back home multiple items of clothing that I never wore. I felt so relieved when I cut down on the amount of things in my closet. The film helped open my eyes to the fact that clothes and accessories hold no value in the long run.  Today we live in a society where living lavish is the goal.  After watching the film, I believe individuals must realize they can be just as happy living simply.

Yes, consumerism is definitely making us anxious about keeping up with the trend. However, being a minimalist is not easy. It takes lots of effort to persist, especially when people around are still into consumerism. Concerning this factor, converting the whole society into minimalism is challenging. Every company, economist and government would love to see consumers purchase goods and generate sales which boost the GDP. On a personal level, people may find it difficult to not care about what others think; to them, being a minimalist is like being a monk. Thus, practicing minimalism is not practical for now. Nonetheless, we can change this situation with time. First, we can promote the public’s awareness of the danger behind climate change. Second, we must regulate the pollutions  which is used by companies. Last but not lease, citizens must be encouraged to learn more about the connotative meaning in minimalism and spontaneously put it in action. I believe that in time, we will be able to get enough people to reinvent our materialistic culture!

I watched the film “Minimalism” and was immediately captivated. I was taken back by how little Joshua had in his home, but then I started to think about how much I have and how much I do not use. As the documentary went on I though why not be a minimalist, it sounds amazing! You would be saving money by living in a small home and saving the Earth with such a small carbon footprint. Before this film I was really thinking what is the point of working so hard at a job and they proved my point. Why work 40+ hours a week and miss out on being with friends or family, we are only here for a limited time anyways. Besides that, they brought up consumerism and fast fashion and I was shocked that they said we have “52 season a year for clothing” because so many women I know always want to be up to date in the world, but after that it was like there is really no way. It makes me grateful for thrift stores because just like having a small house you are saving yourself money as well as saving our only home. I hope that there is a change from my generation soon and I know after this weeks videos and reading I will be conscious of how I consume.

I totally agree with you. I was fascinated by the way these people lived their life, and could totally see myself living that sort of life in the future (or my version of it). The tiny houses that a few of the people in the documentary were living in seemed really nice. I feel like I would enjoy living in a small house like that, especially because of the money I would save. Another living situation that was interesting to me was the designers who organized their apartment around their lifestyle. I love the idea of designing homes and apartments to efficiently cater to the way humans live. It has economical and personal benefits. The problem is not everyone has the money or access to a designer that can make this possible in their own lives.

There were two quotes that caught my attention. The first was from Gail Steketee (PhD. Compulsive-Hoarding Expert): “It is clear that as human beings we have strong attachment, initially in our lives, to people who are caring for us, and sometimes it feels like those attachments spill over to objects, as if they were as important as people. I’m not so sure that we have a great relationship with things”. I feel very strongly that kids are starting to put more importance and attention on things like technology, and are quickly losing creativity. The other quote came from Juliet Schor (PhD. Economist and Sociologist): “We are toon materialistic in the everyday sense of the word, and we are not at all materialistic enough in the true sense of the word”. I thought this was a very creative way at looking at the current crisis of overconsumption. I enjoy cleverly worded and well thought out ideas.
<br><br><hr><br>
I too was feeling guilty for how many things I have in my life that I don't really need and it made me go back to the point of when I bought this stuff and I can't member why I wanted to buy these things...it's so weird. I remember reading the book "The Man Who Quit Money" a few years ago and I thought the guy was crazy. After this video, and as more time goes on, I am realizing how why the man in the book quit the idea of money and consumption. I really applaud the people who take the time to sit down with themselves and ask themselves if the way they're living is the right way to live!
<br><br><hr><br>
Like you, I was completely captivated by the film. Even though I’ve heard of the basics of minimalism before, this film opened my eyes to just how minimalism can be utilized to improve people’s lives. Rather than superficially borrowing elements from this movement, the people in the film actively utilized minimalism to improve their lives in a vast variety of ways. I also feel a bit disgruntled at the prospect the purpose of my life might just be material pursuits. In a chase for material goods, I’m concerned of losing time with the people who are important to me while adding to the environmental crisis through my consumerism. Therefore, it’s immensely inspiring to see someone like Joshua who has successfully taken a different path. Rather than rejecting materialism, the people in the film embrace materialism in a radically different way. They cherish the few things they have with tremendous value as opposed to the traditional relationship people have with things where material goods are so abundant any individual good looses its value. The think the idea of diminishing returns definitely applies in this case. So, it’s really cool to see how minimalism is able to truly give value to material goods in a way that modern consumerism simply cannot. I see incredible value and potential in this movement. Materialism has caused people to become more attached to junk and the environment to deteriorate. In my opinion, minimalism, if embraced to the same extent as materialism, has the potential to bring people closer together and this planet more hospitable.
<br><br><hr><br>
like you, I was also surprised by how little stuff Joshua and Ryan had in their houses. I think it is very impressive how the people in this movie were able to turn away from something that they all have worked so hard for. I think it gives a good example of what is really important in human life. If they, after spending so much time chasing after the "American dream", were able to turn their lives upside down, then regular people can do it too, and with much fewer barriers. 
<br><br>
And I also hope that my generation and the ones that follow can understand that there is no meaning behind the things the companies want us to buy -- all of it is simply manipulation. We should recognize our actual needs from the superficial ones, because if we don't, we will follow the template of the modern consumerism lifestyle that gets us nowhere.
<br><br><hr><br>
As I watched the movie, I started to feel the same way about how truly minimal Joshua really was. I agree that minimalism at times is very favorable to the overcrowded lives we live, but I also remember how hard it would be to adopt at a large scale in a society. Besides that, I myself know many people that get new clothes every single time there is a new trend and never stop until their bank account hits zero. In my opinion, fast fashion to the average consumer may temporarily boost morale, but in the long run the money they spend and the impact it has on the earth outweigh the rush of being up to date. I myself have worn the same clothes combined with hand me downs from my brother for the last 5 years or so, only buying 1 to 3 new clothing items per year. The other part of the equation presented very clearly in the movie in terms of bringing down items in general seems to be a tall task that would take very careful planning to achieve.
<br><br><hr><br>
I truly do believe that we have the ability to “maximize minimalism”. As of now, it seems that we have been maximizing materialism and consumerism by building off one another’s tendencies. We humans have the natural “want” to overpower one another, to do better than someone else and—when they get ahead—to work hard until we one-up them yet again. This cycle just continues to build and build, until it becomes a head-on race of everyone against everyone. I feel as though this is such a tedious waste of a precious life. The majority of good things in life are truly free, and the constant yearning of material items will only leave an unfillable hole in your life. 
<br><br> 
Just like setting your expectations low on a test, for example; if you expect to get a C, or are even used to getting C’s, then getting a B would feel amazing. However, if you are constantly striving for straight A’s, getting a B will be a huge disappointment. While this is not the best analogy, it is one that I often think about, since I myself often foolishly compare my qualities and accomplishments to those of the peers surrounding me. 
 <br><br>
“Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in freedom”. If we were able to become accustomed to the “bare minimum” in life, then anything more would feel truly wonderful. But, there would be no desire for something more. There would be no constant yearning to do better than those around you, to fight over differences and resent one another for the unchangeable. What if we could all just live in perfect harmony, building off of one another’s accomplishments and working together to compile our qualities into a huge greatness. I feel as though we truly do have the ability; however, not enough people have the will to change, especially when they already have set expectations for what they believe to be the good in life. 
 <br><br>
While I hope that our world can undergo a drastic shift in this mindset, I am—unfortunately—quite doubtful. However, I will continue to strive to do what is best for the greater good because I feel as though—in return-- I receive the good too. I want to affect people’s lives as positively as possible, by building them up instead of competing against them and repetitively knocking them down. If we all could build together, we would achieve true greatness, and the true extent of the meaning of life.

I too was taken back at first when I saw how little josh owned. Within the first five minutes of the film I immediately thought to myself: who would ever want to live like this? However, by the end of the film this question turned into: why don't we all live like this? This film was an awesome and interesting way to share the idea that we as a society are too concerned with consumption. As explained in the film this has become a cultural problem and it is now deeply embedded in society. We revolve around constant consumption. We do it not because its necessary but because it is what society tells us to do. It is what we think will bring us happiness. However, this is all an illusion. 
<br><br>
The part that I really loved about this film was the way that minimalism was shared. These two guys went all over the place spreading this idea in order to help others find happiness. They wanted to share the information that changed their lives. I though the part that stood out the most to me was the idea that by constantly consuming we spend all of our time working and trying to get more and more when we miss out on the things that really matter In our lives. Unfortunately for josh, part of his consumption problem was not spending enough time with his mother. I think this is a lesson for us all to learn. We need to focus more on what truly matters and not how much material objects we have.
    <br><br><hr><br>
I too was surprised by the 52 seasons a year for clothing because that means a different season each week and I know trends move fast, but a week wow. However, in regards to your comment about working hard, I don’t think the documentary was trying to say that there’s no point in working so hard at a job. I think the point of showing the guy who walked out of his promotion, was to show that we all aren’t meant for just one path. Life isn’t a labrinth, but in fact a maze with numerous routes. Also, for some working hard at a job is self rewarding beyond the money aspect or the idea of success. For instance, some might work really hard at a job and put a lot of energy into it because they believe that it’s for the greater good and/or they might have such a big passion for their job that it gives them a sense of purpose.
<br><br><hr><br>
    I agree with you, I was also amazed by seeing how they were able to live in such a small space. I had previously seen small housing trending on youtube and thought it was a joke. Well, I guess not. Personally, I would’ve thought it’d be impossible to live there, but after thinking it through and seeing that I don’t have much stuff, It would work out. Living in a small space has many pros and I could see myself as a minimalist in the future. What is the point of owning a big property if you will spend the majority of your time working to pay it off? It’s complete nonsense. You work hard to literally go home and sleep. There will be no happiness in that household since it'll be full of emptiness.
<br><br>

Another thing that I found interesting was Project 333, where the person only wears 33 items for 3 months. The items include clothing, shoes, and accessories, 33 items seems like a small amount, but consider the man who carried a suitcase with him for the entire trip. As said in the video, “We’ve been told we need those things by society” and they especially try to target little kids. They make everything seem like a necessity when we’re able to live off a few things. I was shocked to hear that in 1983 companies spent $100 million in marketing, and by 2006 they spent $17 billion. Yes, 17 BILLION.
<br><br>

I also agree on how being able to shop at thrift stores will help your budget and the planet.
<br><br>
Now imagine if everyone thought like us and realized that it’s better to buy used clothing even if it has become “worthless” and live in a comfier home. With the housing being smaller, you’ll actually be in every corner, not compared to a big house, where you don’t enjoy the space. And I can say this from personal experience, I live in a small house and all my family is happy together in the living room, dining area, kitchen, and bedrooms, meanwhile, my boyfriend’s home is much big, and it feels uncomfortable since there’s an emptiness. You may think bigger is better, but it’s not true.

I also agree with the idea that we engage both too much, and too little, in materialism. We rely too much on material goods for our happiness, feelings of self worth and value, and overall success, and disregard them for what their actual value-utility-is to us. We spend too much time and effort engaging in the pursuit of these items such that, in the process, we become disconnected from our true dreams and ambitions, instead imbuing our minds with unattainable ideas of what success and happiness means. The more that's going on-the more you have to worry about-the less productive this worrying is. It is also interesting to see just how well Thoreau's attitudes about minimalism and the excessiveness of society applies to our current lives; we should  worry about having our basic needs met-our necessities. Overall, the minimalist mindset interests me because it makes it easier to disconnect from our distraction-filled lives and reflect on what is really important to us, and what our true desires and goals are.

I thought this film was very interesting and was very thought provoking on topics of lifestyle and happiness. I am well aware with our countries constant pursuit of something bigger and better and the ridiculousness of this way of living was instilled in me from a young age. I was always taught to know the difference between a need and a want and to be content when my needs were met. I do find myself holding onto objects as I am afraid to let go. I am always afraid of that one situation that may come up where I will need that specific item, so I am hesitant to purge as much as these minimalists do. I thought it was a very compelling concept though, where everything had a purpose and letting go of the excess led to freedom. I feel as though if more people lived by this lifestyle of doing more with less we would live in a very different society with very different ideals. While at first I was wondering how exactly this film about minimalism connected to our course of climate crisis, I started making connections and realizing how much it really had to do with environmental sustainability.
<br><br>
 Making this lifestyle changes can have so many implications for lowering one's carbon footprint. The minimalists talked about how they only had a few vital pieces that made up their wardrobe. By doing this, they are not actively supporting the fast fashion industry that has huge detrimental effects on the environment. By utilizing smaller spaces for their homes, they conserve their footprint as well. Their whole belief system of living deliberately lends itself directly to living in an environmentally cautious way. We need to worry less about material goods that bring us momentary pleasure especially when they have environmentally harmful implications. If we find our satisfaction within ourselves, and truly actively think through every purchase we make, we can make a huge impact on the climate crisis. Maybe this means to stop supporting fast fashion, going vegetarian, riding your bike more, or being conscious of the waste you produce. Whatever it is, these small lifestyle changes can make such a big difference and that was the main message I got out of this film.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” was very insightful and inspiring, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Even before watching the film, I had strongly believed that a minimalistic approach to life can prove to be a great source of happiness, as well as a potential solution to the problem of anthropogenic climate change. 
<br><br>
The quote that stood out to me the most was at the end of the documentary: “Love people and use things, because the opposite never works.” I find this to be so important, especially in a world in which people seem to think that having more “things” yields a happier life. In many circumstances, this is not the case. True and lasting happiness often comes from interaction with others; as we grow, love, and laugh with one another, we learn to appreciate the best parts of life itself without any interruption from the unfortunately idealized materialistic life. The happiness we experience from human interaction cannot be replaced with material objects, as love for “things” can never reach the true value of life. However, there is definitely something to be said about objects bringing someone joy, and in that, minimalism seems to be the perfect route.
<br><br>
In regards to the environment, I believe that minimalism tackles one of the underlying issues of climate change: consumerism and the constant need for “more.” On and individual level, consumerism is damaging the planet through excessive use energy and resources, and to cut back on the amount of stuff we buy would be helpful in the healing of our planet. However, on a larger scale, such as the fossil fuel industry, constant longing for more money and fuel is extremely harmful to our planet. The fossil fuel industry seems to endlessly exploit natural resources for their own personal benefit, taking an economic approach of maximalism. Minimalism on individual scale would be very beneficial if partnered with other tactics on lessening one’s carbon footprint, but to shy away from the “more is more” idea in the fossil fuel industry would make even more of a positive impact on our planet.

Just like you, I prefer minimalism before watching “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things.” It helps me get away with consumerism and seek the true happiness. This documentary enables me to have a even deeper understanding about the concept of minimalism. For an individual, minimalism allows me to consider what I really want and what truly makes me happy. Instead of consuming products to satisfy my endless desire, which kind of joy cannot last long, I spend more time with friends and family, and enjoy the beauty of nature more often. By embracing the truth of life, I obtain true and long-lasting joy. I seldom worried about things like "I cannot afford all the luxury product (which is actually unnecessary) and will lose face among the peer." In contrast, I love and enjoy my life more after having less. For the society, minimalism also plays a significant role in protecting the Earth. Because if people stop consuming more than what they really need and producing goods beyond the level that nature resources can bear, climate change will be greatly mitigated and our living environment will soon get better. The minimalism documentary strengthens my faith to live a simple life since it brings me joy and is a fundamental step of saving the planet.

I agree that the last sentence of the film had a lot of impact. Most good memories people have revolve around the people you’re with and not the things you are using. Our most important life events are about being with other people. People are what make us the happiest, material items might bring some joy but not nearly as much as maybe your wedding day or spending mother’s day with your mom. It’s important that we focus our time with friends and family so that we can have memories of spending time with our loved ones instead of spending that time looking for new things to buy or sitting on our phones playing games.
<br><br>
For the environment, I believe buying fewer things is one of the easier ways to help our environment. When going out if we just think about helping the environment instead of buying that new shirt it’s not that hard of a choice if you already have a ton of shirts. It’s not even just buying fewer things but also buying used things could help drastically. Luckily thrift stores have become increasingly popular over the last few years. If we could continue popularizing things that help our environment, then we could truly help our Earth.
<br><br><hr><br>
I also found the film very insightful. I personally do not live a very minimalist lifestyle. While watching the film, I found myself reflecting on my purchases. Many of my purchases are made out of necessity, but it doesn't stop there. Many of my purchases aren't made out of necessity too; I'll buy things even if I don't need it but think it's cute. I often find myself having too many things and ultimately have to hoard them in boxes, only to throw it away years later. In college, I definitely try to limit my spending and reap the benefits of having less things to worry about and a fuller wallet. The film made me think about living a more minimalist lifestyle, as it makes heavy encouragements for it to lead a happier and freer lifestyle. 
<br><br>
The quote you wrote about and its message is very fascinating to me. The message in the quote seems to be a call for the separation of material good and people. It is important to value the people you love and the relationships and experiences you have with them, whereas things should just be for use, to get things done. Objects should not be more valued than the people you love is the message I took from the quote. I agree that minimalism can be a compromise, because you can love the items that you need and enjoy using. This reminds me of Marie Kondo and her show "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo," where she teaches the KonMari way which is to only keep things that spark joy, and anything else is unnecessary. 
<br><br>
Consumerism is one of the roots of the climate crisis. The desire for more drives harmful industries, such as fast fashion. People go through clothes extremely fast, many people only wearing things a few times and never again. Minimalism could certainly be a solution in reducing consumerism. Many huge industries are products of greed and money, built on personal gain and do not care for the after effects; you mentioned the fossil fuel industry. A minimalist lifestyle would reduce consumerism and demand. Our money speaks for us, and if we spend less on unnecessary things, harmful industries will shrink.

This documentary changed how I felt about all the items in my house. When Juliet Shor said that we are materialistic in the sense that we like having a lot of things, but not materialistic in the sense that we actually care about our things, I was shocked by how true that is. Looking around at my house, there is so much random stuff that I don’t care about, things that I got because they look “cool,” and things that just don’t make me happy when I see them. After realizing that this movement isn’t just about getting rid of your stuff, but about only surrounding yourself with things that make you happy, I want to try it out. I feel that it will give me more control over my life. The quote, “one thing you don’t have control over is making more. One thing you do have control over is spending less,” really resonated with me. 
<br><br>
I do, however, have a concern with the minimalist trend. I am worried that people will still buy fast and cheaply made items so that they can have something, a sweater for example, for a month, get sick of it, throw it away, and buy something new. During this time, you will still have a minimalist closet as you only have one sweater at a time, but you are still consuming many items. This would be just as bad environmentally. Instead, as Juliet Shor said, we need to be true materialists and really care about the material of our items. We need to buy items that are environmentally and ethically made and then continue to keep them and use them. The idea of “quality over quantity” is what we should aim for.

This is completely true Elizabeth. Even if we did become more minimalist as a society, our consumerism would still be problematic if we still bough the same items as we do today. Yes we do need to buy less goods, but the goods themselves must be environmentally friendly and ethically produced. 
<br><br>
Yes we could buy less fast fashion clothing, but let's transition away from that industry completely. Buying a more expensive, higher quality, ethically produced is better than buying several items that we will go through a lot faster. 
<br><br>
We must stop buying products that will fill our landfills, and buy products that are eco friendly with minimal packaging and little to no impact on our environment. 
<br><br>
We must also choose ethical brands, that pay their employees a living wage, who work under safe working conditions, with no child labor, and a reasonable amount of hours. 
<br><br>
I don't want my clothes made with the blood of the women in developing countries. I'd rather not wear clothes at all. Thankfully, this is not an option I have to endure. there are brands who will see both eco-friendly and ethically produced goods. If one cannot afford that, second had options are available for almost everything. for me personally, almost everything from my clothes to my shoes to may accessories to my MacBook to my bike were all bought secondhand.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree! I think that it is hard to transition to this mindset when we are surrounded by stores with items at such low prices. One of the quotes from the film stood out to me about this topic, “we’re not going to ever be able to achieve the environmental gains we are seeking, while still expecting our lives to be the same.” Now whenever I go to the store I and get excited about the low price on an item, I try to ask myself, "am I only considering buying this because it is so cheap or is this really a good purchase? Who am I supporting by buying this? Do I really need this or just want it?" Like you, I have also started buying more things second hand. Luckily, living in a college town makes this easier with resources like the UCSB Free and For Sale Facebook page.

I thought this movie was incredibly inspiring. I often think about just how much stuff we have as a society. I have even become more aware as I moved to college and have started living with people who are addicted to shopping that some people really just want to have a lot of stuff. I see these people going online shopping out of boredom or some weird idea that they NEED a new black hoodie, becuase the other four black hoodies they have just aren’t the same. Only to have and wear the hoodie once before needing a repacement for it. Living in a soroity house, the sheer number of packages that we recieve packed full of things every single day is almost disturbing. It is also hard to look at how much packaging comes with all these purchases. Not only is this absurd shopping simply not fulfilling, it hurts the environment in so many ways. I feel that the most important message that is taught through this idea of minimalism is not even trying to keep down to owning next to nothing, I think the most important part is that we keep only the things that add value and happiness into our lives.
I am currently in the stages of packing up my home to move to a different state and going through my things and trying to throw away things that I dont need is eye opening. There are definitely certain things that you grow attatchments to, that are hard to throw away. However, I was instantly able to donate several bags of things. If you take a second to look around and think about how frequently you use things, or even think about the things, you realize just how little these things add to your life.

<p>
After I watched this film , there are several questions came up from my mind: Is there a choice for a happier life? Is it that important to have everything to mean you are happy?What is the meaning of living?And this documentary definitely gave me some answers to these questions I have and make me to re-think about the style that most of us are living right now.

<br><br>
I actually agree with what the documentary said that we are all like the puppets who are controlled by the political power and all those power from advertisements that push us to consume more and more thing even we don’t even need it. Because there is an ideology that money makes you happy and buying expensive things give you a good image. But I think many of us forget what things are necessary and luxury. We are the one being told that we need to buy those things but we are not the one to decide whether we truly need it or not.People nowadays are not just consuming something that will make them to be able to live only, but to enjoy the sense of feeling or proud from having something expensive.
<br><br>

Also, I  think the idea of minimalist is very great and even though not everyone can become a total minimalist, but it reminds us that we all can start from the small things from our daily lives such as buying less things we don’t need to make ourselves live more simple and happy. We all need money to let us to be able to buy clothes, food that every human-being needs. But with the growth of economy and technology, we are indulging ourselves in the use of different products and forget what is the real purpose of living. 
<br><br>
I think changing from over consumption to minimalism doesn’t make us to have another new meaning in lives but it is also doing something good for our environment because there will be less consumption and less waste/trash. It is something that will benefit the environment we are living as well.

I agree that many of us fail to see the line that divides "necessary things" from "luxuries". Often times when people really really WANT something they say "I NEED it". iPhones, laptops, and cars are just a few examples of luxuries that people claim they need but really don't. Consumer culture has undoubtedly affected our perspective on what we need in life for the worse. The psychological effects of advertisements often make consumers feel that purchasing a certain product will provide them something they "need" when in reality this consumption continues to contribute to their mental health negatively. In a sense, our actual needs are being suppressed by the "needs" that advertisements make us think we have to buy. It's sad to say, but consumerism is changing what people in the first world feel they need to have. Consumers are beginning to favor materialistic items over basic needs like food and love.
<br><br>
Extreme minimalism is an idea that I also doubt would be plausible on a large scale, but I think everyone can stop to think about whether or not they really need something before they buy it. Since watching the film, I have engaged with The Minimalists podcast to learn more about this movement and have found that minimalism does not have to be radical to have an effect environmentally and for an individual mentally. I believe that living with less, no matter how much less that might be, benefits oneself and the environment. I have made an attempt to diminish the number of clothes I own by simply giving away the ones I rarely wear. Additionally, I drew inspiration from Ryan and Josh in that when I buy a new article of clothing, I get rid of 2 or more pieces of that kind of clothing. Although I am not a huge minimalist, the changes I have made make my life more simple, easy, and happy.
<br><br><hr><br>
After watching this documentary, I have also same thought as you. I like your comment very much. It's just like saying the voice in my heart. Truly, nowadays, people enjoy the feeling of buying luxury, because they view it as a symbol to show off or they are proud of buying expensive things. However, most of those things are not necessary at all. This phenomenon is such prevalent among modern people. People are lack of sense to control themselves from buying  such expensive and unnecessary things, instead they are proud of it. Personally, I think modern people are supposed to learn the idea of minimalist, and conduct this idea from small things in daily life, such as asking ourselves whether we really need something before we pay for it. It will not only good for ourselves, but also good for the environment.

The film is effectively communicating its subject since it uses a lot of specific examples and interviews with people to explain how people from very different backgrounds found happiness through a minimalist lifestyle. The social problems raised in the documentary, such as too many materialistic people, car addiction, excessive clothing consumption, and toy consumption, have also aroused my thinking. What makes me most impressed is that the speakers mentioned that “money can’t buy happiness.” I think that although money can bring material satisfaction, it cannot bring true happiness to you. There is nothing wrong with pursuing something better, but it should be bought according to the needs, otherwise, it will become a waste. Therefore, we need to consider whether we really need it before buying it, and this way will also help us to reduce waste. From my perspective, I have the same opinion as Professor Ken talking in the video. More and more people confirm that the minimalist lifestyle is better than our lifestyle now. We not only need to consume less but also need to consume the right thing. For example, we can buy some environmentally friendly products instead of plastic and disposable products. All in all, I think the minimalist lifestyle is reasonable and necessary in our society now.

I always questioned the motivation behind our seemingly innate need to want more and more until watching "Minimalism." The biological need for people to long for things makes sense during a time in early human development where food and resources were scarce, but that “autocraving” is unnecessary today. I find it ironic that as we are reaching such a high standard of living, we are simultaneously ruining it through our materialistic achievements. Especially in the developed world, the houses we buy, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, and the excessive amounts of material goods that fill our lives are seen as indicators of a successful life. But how successful is it really if everything we are consuming is ruining our future, and the futures of all living things on the planet? 
<br><br>
Adopting a minimalist mindset requires us to take a step back and look at our habits of extreme consumerism without reason. Growing up in the age of social media, it is easy for me and other members of my generation to get caught up in marketing techniques of the hundreds of new products being thrown at us every day. This ideology also feeds into the concept that everything has to be “new” and thus encourages us to buy more and waste more until we unconsciously become addicted to buying anything and everything. To change this mindset, we must also change social norms. Rather than using mass media and public figures to further consumerism, we should use our platforms to influence the opposite: sustainable products, and only when necessary.

In Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things, filmmaker Matt D’Avella documents Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Milburn’s travels around the country to spread the word about consuming less. The film effectively communicates the idea that consumerism and spending and buying more is not the true pathway to finding happiness. Moreover, they describe how spending less brings more peace of mind. An important aspect that made this film effective for me was that it conveyed a deeply emotional picture of being present for other people. One particularly touching moment in the film was when Nicodemus and Milburn describe their past trauma and how it has driven them to get to the point they are at. There is also an argument against fast fashion and getting rid of an excess amount of clothing or things. By removing consumerism, there is an ability to connect with the people around you. In addition, a former NBC reporter speaks on the value of letting go of anxiousness and rumination. Both of which can be seen to contribute to our constant need for more. This film has helped me further realize that I should be aware of my consumer habits. I really enjoyed the film’s dialogue on America’s consumer habits, and the quest to break free from that in order to become closer to what’s more important. This idea of minimalism does not take away and minimize, but rather helps us to add a truer value to life. I think the message this film promotes is important to share with others, allowing people to become their more authentic selves.

Just last week I was having a conversation with some of my friends about what we were going to wear for a party, and everyone, including myself, kept repeating “oh my god I have nothing to wear! I don't know what to do”. I didn’t think twice about the fact that everyone was saying this, as I hear it all the time. When they were explaining the 333 theory in the documentary “Minimalist”, I was brought back to that conversation I had last week. I realized that every single one of my friends has closets stuffed with hundreds of items of clothing, most of them bought in the last year. How could all of us possibly have nothing to wear if we all have so many freaking clothes? The answer is that we do have “something” to wear, we just aren’t happy with what we have after we buy it. Every time I go shopping, I love whatever I buy until I take it home. It usually just sits there in my closet, never to be worn. It's not that I don’t like it, it's just that the feeling of buying it is what brought me joy, not owning the item. I felt like this documentary snapped me out of some sort of haze. I'm now questioning all of the reasons that I buy stuff. I’ve never considered myself someone who owns a lot of stuff, or someone who has the desire to shop all the time. But when I saw the guy in the documentary who could fit all of his stuff in two bags I was stunned. Just the items I brought to college could barely fit into a large car. I feel that teenage girls probably have the most stuff out of anyone I know. I think the reason for this is because we are usually the ones who are most concerned with how we look, staying fashionable and trendy, and fitting in. Most of the stuff I have I probably wouldn’t have if other people didn’t have it, and I think it goes the same for most other people. We all just want others to think highly of us or to think highly of ourselves, and we are conditioned to think buying stuff will help us get to that point. I think the environmental impact is only a portion of the reason that our society should have less stuff. We just simply don’t need it, and it seems to be causing much more harm than good.

Fashion, trends, wants, social media etc. are pushing people to gain more and more, the culture is out of control because people have more purchasing power to get what they want. The society is defining the boundary of basic and unsatisfaction. Consumption is eating up the human races and the society that hard to control. The society is telling us to buy and buy more to be “good”, it seems pathetic to me because I am a part of the consumerism. I want a good-looking car, luxurious housing and fancy apparel, but we all need a way out by realizing a simpler lifestyle could be much better for people. 
<br><br>
I feel consumerism is the main reason for people to exploit more resources and another main driver is the social media that people want more social recognition.

I saw the film Minimalism for the first time a couple of years ago, when I first encountered minimalist lifestyle videos via YouTubers such as Matt D’Avella, who is actually the cinematographer for the documentary! I became quickly intrigued with minimalism for its practicality. I realized how many things I owned that had no impact on my life, just taking up space. Two years later, my life has not drastically changed - I still have much more clothing than I need and would not consider myself a “minimalist” per say. But I can definitely say that this film really helped change my relationship with things. I don’t buy things mindlessly anymore, I am intentional about the things I own and if there’s something old in my closet that’s not sparking joy anymore, I can get rid of it easier than before. I had never thought about the environmental impact that adopting a minimalist lifestyle would have, but this film gave me hope that cultural change is possible. People don’t like being told that their lifestyles are harming the planet. They don’t like being forced to change, especially when they perceive their consumerist lifestyles to be a source of happiness. I think that by spreading the message that materialism won’t make you happy, and the positive impacts that a minimalist lifestyle can have on your wellbeing — people like myself will resonate and begin to steer away from excessive materialism. One aspect of the film that I found particularly appealing was the idea that living in smaller homes could allow you to work less and live a more content life overall. While I don’t think the entirety of Americans will love the idea of small houses and only wearing 33 items, I think minimalism is definitely a lifestyle worth adopting even if just in small ways, like purchasing primarily second hand and shopping from huge corporations like Amazon less. Watching this film a second time with the climate crisis in mind inspired me to be even more conscious of my consumption and the ways I can minimize even further.

I was first introduced to minimalism by watching Matt D'Avella's youtube videos as well. I never thought of the environmental implications before either, but watching the documentary through the lense of this class was interesting. It's nice that minimalism helps one's individual carbon footprint as well as one's well being. I think it's a good idea to only consume what you need, and not more. You can get less clothes and keep them for longer and still be able to look good. If everyone did that, companies would produce less and therefore emit less pollution as well. The same goes for other products of course, and in not trying get happiness from things you find it more in the things that actually matter.

I found “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” INCREDIBLY therapeutic. Compared to the quite depressing tones of the previous texts and media we have worked with in this class, this documentary was truly a feels good way to learn about a new approach to life. One of the most poignant parts of the film for me was Dan Hariss' story on dealing with his ptsd and meditation. It leads the problem I think many people have with overlooking all the beautiful parts of life we are blessed with and looking to what we don't have. The idea of meditation is such a unique way of approaching the problem of climate change, a problem that can often be depressing and overwhelming to think about. Just taking the time to appreciate what we have around us, the birds, the trees, clean air, good health, shelter etc, we can begin to see the importance of taking care of the planet we live on by cutting down how much "stuff" we use. And who knows, step by step we can learn to value our surroundings to the point of propagating a greater drive against the climate crisis.
<br><br>
It's not exactly clear how one can apply this to the struggle against the climate crisis at first glance, but the documentary opens you up the very critical theme we make in trying curb our carbon footprint. Fighting climate change  doesn't have to be about "oh I'm losing x y z, you're taking away my freedoms, it's my god-given right to own and use blah blah blah." It can be simply about finding love and value in what we have around us and using those things to the best of their ability.

I had mixed feelings about the film. At some parts, I found it therapeutic just like you. The film really shows you so many ways you can 'minimalize' your life and change the way you live, for a win-win situation. Your life can become less cluttered, you harm the environment less, you're free of the burdens of consumerism and materialism that society has placed upon us, etc. Yet, I also found myself being disillusioned at times. I thought to myself, 'can I really live such a lifestyle?' and 'am I capable of changing my ways'? for example. I also felt disillusioned because I thought about how, even if thousands upon thousands of people were to begin living their lives in this minimalistic way, there’s still millions of people living in the developed world who will not change their ways, and continue to fuel things like the fast fashion industry, the fossil fuel industry, and continue to live lives of rampant consumerism. So in the end, will there even be a significant difference?
<br><br>
I do however wholeheartedly agree with your point on meditation. Climate change definitely is an extremely depressing topic, because the basic premise is that unless we change our ways the world is pretty much screwed - or at least, human life and civilization as we know it, is screwed. I definitely think meditation, as well a just general self-reflection and introspection, are things that can really help us calm down and relax in the face of such a horrible catastrophe that is befalling our planet. 
<br><br>

Overall, I found the film to be eye-opening and different. It does bring a smile to my face that some people out there are really improving their lives as well as their overall satisfaction and happiness with life, in a way that benefits both themselves as well as the environment. This week was definitely less grim than the weeks before.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really resonate with the sentiment that appreciating what we have and finding the value in our relationships and environment is a really powerful way of dealing with the climate crisis. A lot of our culture seems to revolve around a kind of “rat race” narrative, where everything’s a competition and we need to win by earning the most money and having the most stuff. But if you think about it, material goods are never going to be what we would hold as most important in our lives. This kind of narrative also pits us against each other, which just leads us to more unhappiness.
<br><br>
The real key to changing our lives and being happy is to appreciate what we have. I loved when they said in the movie, that when you realize this is your only life, that everything changes. We only have our lifetime on this planet to do what we can, so it makes sense to appreciate the things that really make us happy, like our loved ones. Changing our perspective to this makes the changes we need to fight the climate crisis much more appealing, because it is about preserving the important things in life, not about giving up some conveniences.

I’m glad we watched this movie because this will force all of us to think about this now. What do we think is most important in our lives? What is worth keeping? What do we want to strive for in our time, what do we want to teach future generations? Thinking about this now, before we really enter the “rat race,” may alter the course of our lives for the better.

Minimalism in today’s society is truly something hard to imagine. However, the short film “The high price of materialism” did a good job at portraying the different changes people could make to all aspects of their everyday lives in order to move toward a more minimalist society. I thought that this short film in particular was interesting, because it not only explained why we need to become minimalists, but also described the different ways being more materialistic actually has many negative effects. It’s so interesting to me because the film basically said that the more you have, the less happy you actually are. If there were a way to make all people become minimalists, I think it wouldn’t take long for people to realize that living in that way really isn’t bad at all. The problem is that there currently is no way to make this happen, so for those who try to become more of minimalists, the process feels alot more difficult when there is always someone who has more than you, making it easy to compare your life to theirs. Like the film touched on, the media plays a huge role in the reason why our society has become so materialistic. When people are constantly being reminded of the things they don’t have, it’s not easy to focus on and be grateful for what they do have. For these reasons, I do feel a minimalist society is possible, but not until it becomes something everyone has to participate in, including celebrities.

I agree with you, especially your first sentence of your comment. It is true, even for myself, to imagine minimalism. Human civilization takes so many years to get everything, and now we are trying to get rid of everything? I believe most people will think this is completely ridiculous at first. However, this video from Ken is a great explanation for everyone to quit the current lifestyle - materialism. Materialism is a selfish lifestyle, people keep buying unnecessary goods for fun. People enjoy the happiness these goods brought. However, happiness should not be dictated by the goods we purchased, but more from our soul and mind. We can still enjoy happiness as we pursue minimalism. Maybe the first step we tried to minimize is hard, but if we do not try it, we will never know the true happiness. The happiness built by material is not actual, and even promotes more materialism to become satisfied. However, because of materialism, there is no satisfaction. Eventually, happiness will collapse, because it is a bubble. Therefore, switching lifestyle is beneficial from both micro and macro perspective. 
<br><br>
Individuals will benefit by having grateful hearts. This is a healthy lifestyle, when more and more people act together, the society will be changed. The society, our planet, will suffer less from wastes and greenhouse gases. By reducing the carbon footprint, humans will again be benefited by living healthier.

"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" impressed me after I finished watching it. This movie reflected how human beings constantly want to buy things or consume unnecessary things. After watching it, I realized how severe wasting and consuming have damaged our environment. To call on minimalism lifestyle, we should consume less and a lot less, it's a simple idea as what Ken has mentioned. It is important for us to understand the responsibility to protect our environment. Ken also illustrated that wealthy people like to buy lots of stuff. From my point of view, it is just a self satisfication. Sometimes, the thing we want to buy is not necessary, but we want it just because it is pretty or we can get complement from others. So in order to spread out minimalism, we should consume less and get rid of unnecessary things.

Yes I'm totally agree with you. I like how you said it is a self satisfaction. I feel good when I get a new pair of shoes, or a nice sweater. I think I feel good because it makes me looks good and to get compliments. But I think it shouldn't be this way. The documentary "Minimalism:.." address it well how advertisement has influenced, stimulated people with the glamorous lifestyle, owning more means more successful and happy. I would like to change my lifestyle as well. A few interesting tips in the documentary is the 333 challenge where people try to incorporate as many outfits as possibles using only 33 items of clothing, accessory. I completely agree that instead of spending money on materials, it's more important to spend that on experiences, living small, and closer to nature like going backpacking, having that wanderlust. This lifestyle of minimalism is leading us closer to the happiness all of us craves, it's been all here all along, it's living small, stop getting stimulate by social media, advertisement, make meaningful connections and protect our home, the planet.

I think minimalism is a feasible solution for the climate crisis, however, I don't think there will be many people that can follow the main principle of minimalism. Most people worked most of their time just in order to get a better life such as a bigger house, a better car, more clothes, etc... If someone tells them they need to give up everything they have, I believe no one will follow it. Even though minimalism is a way of living that is beneficial for the climate, I think it still takes a lot of time for people to accept it and finally follow it.

I agree with you in the sense that it will be difficult to get the majority of the U.S. to transition into a minimalist lifestyle. I do have hope though and believe that at some point in the near future more people will begin to pick this way of life up. Having fewer material things in your life removes plenty of stressors, it also allows you to focus on relationships with your loved ones, and all of the beautiful things going on in the environment around us. I truly think that once people come to realize that the minimalist way of life is much less demanding and harsh for the planet, the decision will be a no brainer. I think it is safe to assume that most of the population does not enjoy being stressed out and would rather be happy every day. The hardest part to get over for our country will be giving up the money being made, as everyone enjoys their hard-earned salaries. My parents, as well as the generation before them, will have a difficult time transitioning into becoming minimalists, so I think my generation will have to be the ones to make the change. Those of us who are aware of the minimalist lifestyle and the benefits it proposes must try and spread the word of how a change in living can have a truly have profound effect on the life of an individual. After all, if we continue to live as we are now, our earth will not be able to sustain its health. With no earth and no other home to travel to as of right now, money won't mean a thing.

I watched “Minimalism” in English 22, however, I remember how impactful I found the film to be to my personal life. Looking back on my response, I noted the quote “Love people and use things, because the opposite never works” which is stated at the end of the film and as a result incited a bit of personal reflection. I would never judge my friends or family based on their material wealth, in terms of what they wear or the things they own, simply because their personal character matters so much more to me. However I often find myself critiquing my own belongings, which in terms of the film, is pointless as long as the item can successfully serve its purpose.  As human beings it’s part of our nature to want the newest and best developments in fashion and technology, however if we as a society can practice a bit of gratefulness for the items already in our possession then maybe the feeling of contentment will have the possibility to be transformed into happiness.  The video “The High Price of Materialism” stated that the “Good Life” is related to consumerism, then gave the statistic that those who have high emotional ties to consumer items will experience more unpleasant emotions due to their dissatisfaction with their material belongings. Thus the toxic mindset of consumerism is revealed, in which the benefits of minimalism become emphasized not only due to its environmental appeal but also since it has been proven to make one happier in life by owning fewer possessions. 
<br><br>
 One thing I found quite ironic was the fact that after watching this video, I got suggested a ton of YouTube “haul” videos. Seeing as this is my school email, which I only use to watch Ken’s videos, I found this strange. Almost as if my presumed interest, from watching this video about minimalism, was threatening consumer culture so the Youtube algorithm suggested videos that glorify materialistic lifestyles in response. This definitely made me a bit uncomfortable and I felt as though societal beliefs can highly influence an individual through social media and other forms of technology.

I agree with you on the belief that personal belief, rather than material wealth, determines a person on a more meaningful and profound level. I also believe that usefulness of a product should be the major factor we consider when deciding whether or not to purchase or remain it. Minimalistic lifestyle can not only reduce our financial burden, but also add to the sustainability and simplicity of our life, which are more likely to make our life more efficient, harmonious, and happy. 
<br><br>
When I was watching this film, I was also reflecting on my childhood. My family was not that well-off when I was a child, and my family was rather thrifty, so when I saw some fancy and relatively cheap toy sold on the street, I called my parents insistently to buy them, but my parents were very firm and refused to buy me that toy. Now, when I retrospect on that, I can feel that my parents are very rational regarding to what to buy and how to educate me. My mom always tell me "buy what you need, not what you FEEL like you need", and she also tells me to ask myself if I really need it and is there anything in our home that has similar uses before I buy something. Those habits of her help my family to accumulative some fortunes (so they can support my upper education) and have also helped to build my character of being minimal on my life. Although sometimes I also feel a little bored with the few stuff I own, but I also feel that being clean, healthy, and simple is pleasant, which can be achieved by owning a few high-quality things. By owning a minimal amount of things, I also feel that there is more time and effort for me to do the more important and meaningful things in my life, such as learning to empower myself with the knowledge and skills to do and achieve things that can add a positive impact to our world, adding value to myself by learning or caring myself, or having a deep talk with my friend to relieve their worries or help them to get out of the difficulties they are facing...
<br><br>
Rationally thinking about stuff and rationally thinking about our life is an important step to a meaningful life and a life in your own control, or freedom. Thanks to education from my parents and school and self-reflection, I am becoming more rational in this aspect, which not only makes me happier but also allows me to more harmoniously treat our environment. Minimalism, or a pursuit of simplicity of life, is definitely an effective way to pursue a better life. The underlying principle is to shift our focus on material wealth to spiritual and internal wealth, which are more profound and long-lasting.
  <br><br><hr><br>
  I too was in English 22 last quarter so I watched the two short films. I agree that it is much more important to love people and use things rather than vice versa because other people are how we as humans find joy in our lives- they are our friends, our spouses, our children. People make up every aspect of your life and you can’t escape society without escaping humanity and the other way around.
<br><br>
A quote that really stuck out to me was that “growth itself degrades planetary resources”. I think that our society (specifically the American society), should be more aware of this fact because we live a life that is only considered truly successful if we are in a good economic state (the better our economic state, the better we are doing in life, or so we are told). But, if our society was told that growth as a whole is bad for our planet, would we really worship the economy like we are doing right now? Would we really look towards monetary gains to define our happiness? I think not.
<br><br>
It is interesting that you brought up the fact that the YouTube algorithm wanted you to watch videos of hauls because sometimes I wonder if this is occurring to me as well, outside of youtube. For example, any time that I choose to look at an online shopping site, any page I visit after will have an add either about that specific site or a sister site (for example, abercrombie and fitch/hollister). I wish that, instead of advertising these brands, we would get more eco-friendly advertisements, maybe advertisements about sustainable clothing companies or similar enterprises.

Before watching "Minimalism," I thought it meant abandoning anything and everything in your life. But this documentary showed me that it is more about the value of things and enriching yourself with people who make you happy. It was interesting to see the different ways that people simplified their life but all came to the same conclusion in terms of morals and feeling whole. I've always admired the minimalist aesthetic, but this film really put it into perspective that is it not just a lifestyle. As corny as it sounds, minimalism is a way of life. Letting go is a hard process, but once you do, you truly realize what's important, and what makes you happy. Throughout this film, I felt a sense of comfort because it was so different from what I had been seeing online. Seeing people live their life, stripped to the basics as opposed to the jewelry, colorful clothes and shoes I see on the media was heartfelt? I'm not sure how to describe it.  From personal experience, I know what it feels like to search for meaning through objects. The other day, I was debating on which backpack to buy based on the color and style when either would have been efficient. When Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemu decided to embark on this path, they mentioned how hard it was but also how it was necessary. I truly believe the same thing in terms of climate change. While it may be hard, climate change is here and I think simplifying our lives could really have an impact. While I do not necessarily mean giving up all the objects in your life, I think cutting down could be helpful. 
<br><br>
Project 333 also grabbed my attention because I unintentionally did the same thing when I was starting college. I knew that I would be moving into a dorm with a standard closet. And I knew that my parents would not want to make a double-trip so I made sure I packed light. I did not exactly pack 33 items from my closet, but I let go of a lot of clothes and brought only things that I loved and found comfortable. Doing that, I realized how much clothes I didn't wear, or wore once and had been sitting in my closet since then. Our earth is in a state of emergency, and unfortunately, my generation has to deal with its consequences. However, because of this, we know better and we know we want better. Minimalism is a cool way to lessen your carbon footprint, but choosing to approach that lifestyle could be hard or feel impossible. I enjoyed how they touched upon minimalists who live with other people. I had doubt but seeing their point of view was eye-opening. Nonetheless, simplifying is I think, very essential to helping the planet and taking a step against the climate crisis.

Just like you, I felt it too when I saw the comforts that a simple life can give after giving up so much. I really do think that having a lot of space and owning a lot of materials can become very stressful. Now that I live in a dorm, I feel much more organized. I do not have to worry about picking up all the materials I would have on the floor of my room which is double the size of the room I am currently in. I also don’t have to worry a out turning off a tv or having to open my closet and look at 50 pieces of clothing, struggling to choose one and in the end not wear none. I feel like having so much stuff in our lives really causes us to make decisions that make us unhappy.
<br><br>
I can relate with you in terms of moving in to a dorm and packing light. I also didn’t pack much and only brought things that I use every day. It feels great because everything I brought, I use it every day. I just brought like 20 shirts and 2 jackets and like 8 jeans which I watch every week and reuse the following. So yeah, minimalism doesn’t seem bad at all. I feel like we should really promote more of this idea. I feel like a lot of us out there can actually see the worth behind this sacrifice and might actually agree to change.

After watching "Minimalism: a Documentary About the Important Things", "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy", and "The High Price of Materialism" I understand how this simple lifestyle can not only make the climate crisis and the economy better off, but make human beings better off as well. We have been cultivated in an environment where material goods are put on a pedestal. This encourages competition amongst us all and can result in depression and anxiety. If we take this pedestal away, these side effects will go away with it. It is easy to say that we should just stop valuing material goods, however, when it comes down to it, it is not easy to persuade materialistic nations to change. Many people do not realize that complacency is temporary with this mindset. There is always something new, making your happiness for something that was once "new" diminish. I am, like most people, guilty of wanting the newest iPhone, a new laptop, new shoes, and more. After English 22, I learned to change my mindset and have restricted myself from buying more things. It is definitely hard to stop being materialistic when the world around me is still very much enthralled in materialism. I think we must approach minimalism in the same way that we approach vegan diets or thrift shopping. If we classify minimalism as "trendy" more people will want it and implement it in their lives. I feel like some aspects of sustainability have already become trends. Some celebrities and youtubers have talked about saving the reef, saving the turtles, using reusable water bottles, and eating clean. People with platforms are definitely key in propagating a minimalism lifestyle and I think more people will adopt this lifestyle within the next couple years. Sadly, it looks as though it will take a long time to get every materialistic person to change their mindset.

Materialism comes at a high price — not just explicit costs like buying the consumerist goods but also the implicit costs. You give up the exact time you could be spending with people that make you happy, and instead, you are using the money you have to work for and spending it on things that don't matter unless it is a necessity. For example, in the film, the man gave up the time he could've spent with his mother working, trying to climb the corporate ladder. For what? To have extra income to indulge in materialism.  
<br><br>
I feel in society we are pressured to overindulge to show we are not struggling but if you don't give in to this way of life you can save a lot of money and gain a lot of happiness.

I like the idea of minimalism and am trying to incorporate it into my own life. Growing up, I
always wanted all the new toys and clothes. I never realized that this was just successful tactics
that marketers would aim at children. It is very easy to fall into that trap especially if you want to
fit in with your fellow peers. As I grow older, I realize that the amount of possessions I have
don’t necessarily equal happiness. I’ve grown discontent with the constant ownership of new
materialistic items, I’m now looking for something more meaningful in my life. These
materialistic items can only provide momentary happiness, and ultimately have cluttered my life
and household. I really enjoyed this film because it’s nice to see how other people share the same
sentiment. It proves that a high income, a big home, and materialistic items don’t mean that
you’re happy. The framework of an “American Dream” cannot be applied to everyone, and as
humans get more complex, that false perception of the American Dream also needs to be
reconstructed. I think that it takes a lot of bravery for someone in such a comfortable position to
say that they’re truly unhappy and to create change within their own lives. I admire that and am
aiming to incorporate that into my life— to own things that have meaning and not to fall to other
people’s definition of success.

I agree with you, I also think that consuming does not equate to happiness and that materialistic items does only provide temporary happiness. I would also like to point out that the “American Dream” is only a template to live but not THE template. So living a life as a minimalist does not mean you are not successful, it simply means that you are living life to your own standards and content, and that for me is the true dream. But living as a minimalist does not only help you become less stressed and more happy, it also helps reduce your own carbon footprint. With a smaller house, you do not buy so items and that itself can decrease your carbon footprint. As Ken said in lecture, if you live an average American life thirty percent of your carbon footprint is from your house. So if you start trying to be a minimalist you can pretty much kill two birds with one stone. You can become more content with yourself and not let other people's definition of success matter to you, but you can also reduce your carbon footprint which will benefit not only you but the whole world. And I think that will cause more joy in your life, who would not want that?

I really enjoy the documentary Minimalism and after watching it, I find that minimalism is a really good and appealing idea. I always feel “trapped” by items and products. Like most people, I keep buying objects and always buy some unnecessary products due to impulsive spending. It is really awful not only financially, but also environmentally, and for myself, I even feel unhappy and unpleasant after purchases. The excessive consumer culture leads the society and the mass to a terrible situation and instills them some bad beliefs and values that are against the environment and our planet. We should discard these bad habits and really think about our Earth. 
<br><br>
There are three main ideas about minimalism: affordability, simplicity, and sustainability. To be minimalist, we can spend less and save more money and space, as well as protect our planet. It is really ideal at this point. Another attractive point is that as we no longer worry about material possessions, or, in other words, shake off manipulation of items, we could spend more time on relationships with our families and friends. One of the leading narratives, Joshua Fields Millburn, talks about his experience and is regretful to his mother as he was fighting with work. It is really meaningful and for me, I learn a lesson from it: pretty items and fancy products are not that valuable and they are not what we need to get happiness, however, what we really need is our contacts and relationships with people who we really love and who really loves us.
</p><hr>


<p>
I would recommend the documentary "Minimalism: a Documentary About the Important Things" to every person who wants to not only help the environment but help themselves. The first thing that caught my attention about the documentary, was when Joshua mentioned that minimalism "is just A template, not THE template," and that idea continued throughout the entire film. I think a lot of people don't realize exactly what minimalism is, it's not just about having as little products and items as possible, but able only keeping things that have value to your own life. When Ryan was speaking to an audience, he used an example of a person who loves their collection of books, and I think it's crucial that people realize that you can still have those things that make you happy, but it's about getting rid of the things that just sit there and were purchased for the purpose of having the newest thing and fitting in with the "trends." I put trends in quotations because what exactly determines a trend; an advertiser who simply wants to make more money so he searches for the niche in the market?
<br><br>
Another thing that intrigued me about the film was when Julie mentioned that we really aren't materialistic enough in the sense that humans care about the quantity of material goods that they possess but not the actual material value of each of those goods. When the statistics were put on the screen about how much advertisers had spent on advertising for kids, I was first shocked at the fact that even 100 million was spent in the '80s but then the next number popped up and it read $17 billion which is insane. Children do not have the money but yet we advertiser to them because they don't quite have the mental ability to limit what they really need.  
<br><br>
The final thing that I truly believe will stick with me for the long haul is what Joshua said at the very end of the film, "Love people and use things because the opposite never works" which is something that I think every human should hear at some point in their life.

I think the concept of Minimalism is a viable and meaningful option because it is beneficial to not only our well-beings, but to the American and global environment. To add on to Shianne’s points, Joshua Fields Millburn also stated in his documentary, “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with consumption, the problem is compulsory consumption.” Many American people are addicted to shopping, feeling a need or want to buy something. I don’t see much harm in trying to promote people to wean off this compulsory feeling for instant gratification and to start making meaningful purchases for things that will actually be useful or treasured. Ultimately, getting the American people to become 100% minimalists is too idealistic; Millburn introduces the concept of Minimalism by saying it’s ok to still purchase, as long as they are things of real value to you on a deeper than surface level. 
<br><br>
Another point made by the documentary about excess American consumerism was on the influence of advertising, especially to children. It made me very uncomfortable when the documentary mentioned advertising companies now bypass parents and subject children to gendered and violent advertisements that promote a junk culture and food that’s bad for them (Minimalism Documentary). One of the interviewees eloquently stated, “there’s no positive social benefit from it,” the negatives are so apparent and the political power of advertising overpowers. Ken’s Climate Crisis class is making me so aware of the enormous power politics and money has over what is good for the country’s population and how they do not have the well-being of America and its future generations in mind. This is why bottom-up approaches like the Minimalism concept are necessary and should not be discounted as an option for positive change.

Minimalism is a great documentary for educating people to cherish the most important things around them and solving the climate problem in a special way. I figure out one thing from this video that the root problem to our environment is not only about how much fossil fuels we use today and how much water or food we have waste or dump today but also about a deeper idea that how much we consume today. Minimalism is very effective at digging the root problem of climate change and the ingrained thinking pattern in people. I go along with Ryan and Joshua for the idea that overconsumption that we have been told as a way of showing wealth, happiness, and success is responsible for a positive loop that harms ourselves and the society as a whole and brings negative feelings. The only way to get out of the trap of consumerism and materialism is a spark of an idea that less is better. Ryan and Joshua have been actively passed this idea to many people and I am one of those who think it is inspiring and really helpful. I learned that when I start to sort up my belongings and only leave some of them, I am able to find out my favorite ones and those are indeed the most valuable to me. 
<br><br>
I think this video is trying to reach the general public, especially those who live under the pressure of materialism. It will be strange to hear someone committing to minimalism and we may have concerns about them because they may be hiding from something. However, this is just what normal people would think because we have been taught to get more and more things. The way minimalists want to do is to cut the unnecessary things away and then we are able to focus more on those that truly need our attention to, not just belongings but also our families. This video also appeals to me by showing some inspiring things that I can do right now. Take the 333 challenge as an example. The challenge is to ask people for selecting 33 items including clothes, shoes and jewelry and living with them for 3 weeks. I would really want to try this challenge and I believe everyone should at least try it because I will bring us not only fun but also evoke our fondness to those we really care. From this point, I believe me, who have possession of over 100 T-shirts, over 20 pants and many other decorations will change to the one only with 30 items and start to meditate about the things around me. Keeping doing this, I also believe one day I will abandon consumerism and am able to live a much better life. 
<br><br>
If we abandon the consumerism by practicing minimalism, the environment, and any other thing we appreciate the most are able to survive and maintain for a long time. It is time to ask ourselves the question that “do we really need this much?” When you find the answer is no, you have taken a huge step toward the world with less pollution and more appreciation.

This week’s film was one of my favorites. Growing up, I have never really thought about consumerism and what it has become. As time passes, people are constantly wanting more. The more they get, the more they need. People get dissatisfied a lot faster and a lot easier than before, which is very worrying. In the film, the scenes of people rushing into stores on Black Friday with no compassion for one another was appalling, to say the least. I believe that minimalism is a very beautiful initiative that encourages others to live less, as it actually leads to having more. Hearing that stores and companies market and design clothes for “52 seasons” was ridiculous. This is why I believe that Project 333 is a very smart way to go about life. As the woman said, nobody even noticed that she was reusing the same thirty-three articles of clothing. I, myself, want to attempt this project one day, as I feel that it is important to step out of your comfort zone. In addition, this practice is very environmentally friendly. This film taught me to live life deliberately, as everything you do and buy should be done with a purpose.

I think the film was an interesting choice in showcasing the way in which the lifestyle of the average American will need to change dramatically in the upcoming years. In the last century, we have almost unanimously adopted the saying “Bigger is Better,” with little regard to its impacts on our health, mind, and wallets. Today, obesity is one of the major problems in the USA, and it has a direct correlation to our consumer culture. It was interesting that for the most part, little of what either of the men was doing was because of the environment. It was a decision for themselves because they had an issue with their current lifestyle. The issue is that the average person does not recognize an issue with their lifestyle, or if they do, they don’t have any idea where to look for a solution. Also, for a lot of people the size of their homes or maybe even just the amount of open space around them, has a lot to do with how successful they are. For some who may not be, it could represent the life that they want to live. I think then, that the idea that really needs to be addressed, is how we redefine success. 


The Environmental movement does not differentiate between those with money and those without. It may become an issue sooner for those that don’t have the economic means to protect themselves, but money doesn't guarantee protection. I think it’s important to understand that we do not need to control 100% of the world to live on it. Most species only occupy certain climates and terrains, yet we stretch from corner to corner. If we put all the people on this planet together we could all fit in NYC. We don’t need to take up as much space as we do. Truthfully though, if every person decided that this was how they wanted to live, the way the economic market functions now would collapse. We have been built on a consumer culture, and companies have designed it so that it’s hard to leave. Going against the grain is against human nature.

I found "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" to be a very compelling argument.  The idea of having only what I need or otherwise derive joy from is curious and desirable.  However, I have to admit that I am not sure how I would be able to do this.  We live in a world that is so polluted by people who want everything that it has become a part of life.  I could try to weed out items and purchase less, but at some point I would see something new all my friends had and I would feel compelled to buy it.  We would likely have a great time for 6 months or so, and then we would forget about it.  
<br><br>
The interesting issue that I feel the documentary skirted around was how to fix the boredom that can come from having the same limited number of items.  Though there were some references to how to stay busy, I saw no real course of action that I could follow.  Furthermore, the practice of advertising is thoroughly ingrained in our culture and it is very difficult to step outside the lens of consumerism.  
<br><br>
Though I would certainly prefer a more stress free lifestyle and environment, I do not see how it would be practical.  Though I would love having approximately 50 possessions that I could carry on wherever I went, I do not see how it is possible given both college and the current atmosphere.  So although I am glad I saw this lifestyle and will try to adhere to it as best I can, I do not know how attainable it is for the majority of people, especially those who do not have the income to fall back on to support this lifestyle.  I think the idea is a great ideal we should all strive for, as this is a situation where a partial success is still a benefit to the world.

I agree that this documentary poses a compelling argument for us to take a step back, consider what is really important in our lives, and live according to the things that are actually important. On the surface, it does seem like a difficult task, but you really have to sit down and reflect on the things you own, what you find important, and what is really just noise and a distraction. For myself, meditation is a perfect way to do this. It is a way for you to weed out the noise in your daily life, and gives you a quiet opportunity to ponder questions such as, what is really important to me? Sam Harris, one of the people interviewed in this documentary, is the person who led me into practicing meditation. I suggest taking a look at his work, he has lots of podcasts, guided meditations, and books that are very interesting, and could offer you a new perspective.
<br><br>
While the documentary may skirt around the notion of boredom, you have to ask yourself, why are you bored in the first place? Why do you feel the need to buy or do things to entertain yourself? Why can’t we just sit in peace and reflect or have moments of introspection? Again, meditation, even just 10 minutes a day, could really help us figure these questions out. People are just so used to the noise of everyday life -- advertisements, games, social media, etc. -- that when you strip those things away, you wonder what’s left. But all of that stuff is really meaningless anyways, we just give it meaning and attribute more to it because it’s always there and has been ingrained in us and our “normal” way of life.
<br><br>
Meditation can be daunting at first, and it will be difficult to get rid of the noise and nonsense in our minds, but once you get past that initially it becomes an incredibly useful tool when it comes to questioning what is important in our lives. It would no doubt help people let go of meaningless possessions, or at least reduce the amount we use and depend on them.

For as long as I can remember, I have been naturally drawn to minimalism. Being raised by a single mother who tends to accumulate lots and lots of stuff, a simpler life with fewer, nicer things always seemed more appealing that the alternative. However, I was never aware of the profound environmental and cultural benefits of this approach. Having already watched the film Minimalism last quarter, I watched the two short films “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism,” both of which evoked a sense of hope for the future of our society and our planet. Both films lay out extremely simple solutions to major problems that society today, tackling problems from environmental devastation due to the overproduction and consumption of stuff, to improving the economy and our overall quality of life. 
<br><br>
Visualizing a Plenitude Economy laid the basic foundation and reasoning for creating a “Plenitude Economy” and why this could be a potential solution to improving our overall quality of life and expanding economic opportunity. A plenitude economy looks to changing the way people spend their time, and therefore shifting what we buy, and how we view our lives. By reducing work hours dramatically, employees would receive more benefits, more jobs would be created, people would have more time to cultivate and implement sustainable practices and we would all find a deeper sense of community. Live better, work less. Why the heck haven't we been doing this the whole time?
<br><br>
The short film “The High Price of Materialism” covers how commercialization and consumption has taken over, and how the more people view materialistic possessions, the more they experience depression, substance abuse and anxiety. Consumerism not only influences our wallets, but also our own happiness and relationships with others - when material possession goes up, empathy and regard for nature goes down. As corporate interest dominates the contemporary world through commercialization, the solution is to remove advertisements and debunk the narrative that “stuff” makes us happy. One way to change this narrative is to create a new one, that promotes intrinsic values and wellbeing. 
<br><br>
I believe that minimalism is a fantastic solution to a number of society's problems. People like Thoreau figured this out ages ago, and I think it’s about time that we implement minimalism in our own everyday lives and advocate for a widespread change in policy, for our happiness and for our planet.

I LOVED that film, so much so that just 20 minutes into the film I was texting my parents and family telling them they needed to watch the film. Similarly, I have been reaching out and telling my friends that they need to watch it and will continue to do so. After watching the film, I decided that I want to start cutting down that amount of stuff that I have with the hopes of living a minimalist lifestyle one day. Over the past couple of years, I have been realizing how much stuff I have just lying around that I really never use. Like why do I have 15 different nail polish colors if I never paint my nails? And what is the point of having a box of clothing in my closet that I haven’t worn in at least a year? The biggest hardship for me is what to do with all the stuff that I have that don’t want. I know I could bring my old clothing to a secondhand store but what do I do with all the excess stuff, do I throw it away?
<br><br> 
Something about the video that really stood out to me was how much happier it made everyone who partook on the minimalist lifestyle. On multiple times an individual explained how their wholes lives resolved around making money so that they could buy more things, with the hopes that those things would bring them happiness. This is just a viscous cycle. I see this happening so much in this day in age with clothing, shoes, gadgets, phones and cars. People go shopping for a daily activity, for fun, as “therapy.” How did we take consumerism so far? 
 <br><br>
As with the cars I think the culture has to change behind consumerism for consumption to diminish. Similarly, to my thought on cars I think that it could be possible to get a lot of more and more people on board, but some people will always be attached to their gadgets and endless items because that is what they see as making them happy.  What we need is people like Joshua Fields Milburn and Ryan Nicodemos to speak to more and more people and show they how their lives have changes for the better. Explain to people that they can start with the little steps, and really emphasize the positive environmental impacts of living such a lifestyle. 
 <br><br>
         Another think I took away from this amazing documentary was how much love Joshua Fields Milburn and Ryan Nicodemos showed everyone. They insisted giving everyone a hug and saying, “I’m and hugger” and going straight into the hug. I am willing to bet that before living the minimalist lifestyle they would not have giving everyone they met hugs. It just goes to show you that this way of life brought so much happiness to them. Minimalism really makes you value the people and experiences in your life more than the items your own or the things that you buy. That’s what we need in this world to make a change. 
 <br><br>
I am ready to buy a tiny home right now and get rid of most of my things. Sign me up!

<p>
When I first watched "Minimalism" a couple years ago, I was confused why people would live in such empty homes, seemingly devoid of life. I didn't understand or empathize with the lifestyle even a bit. Now that I'm revisiting it, however, I have come to understand the charm of the film and the merits of living with only what you need. The one international trip I've ever done, I did with my best friend in Peru (since besides the plane ticket, it doesn't get much cheaper), where I met many people like the guy who put all his possessions in two bags. I came to appreciate the materiality of goods, as Juliet Schor puts it, instead of the mindless collection of material goods. This doesn't mean I've become a minimalist, far from that, in fact, but I have arrived at the point where I can understand some small part of what makes that lifestyle appealing when I cast away much of what I owned down to the bare essentials for two weeks. 
<br><br>
What really struck me was when Joshua Millburn read a passage from his book, "Everything that Remains". There is something powerfully universal about the experience of shopping at IKEA. It highlights first the absurdity of "needing" miscellaneous furniture items, but then shifts to how the stuff we put in our homes is used not for it's actual purpose, but for the social value attached to those items. "Does this replica Matisse sketch accurately my edgy but professional vibe?" The rise of social media has only worsened this phenomenon of purchasing goods only for what they might say about you as a person, instead of using them. When we use goods this way, it becomes inevitable that they will not only pile up over time, but that many items will get thrown out in the process. That Slayer shirt was too edgy and no longer defines me as a person. I'm no longer a French press kind of guy, I switched over to Keurig. When this is said out loud, it becomes absurd, but those thought processes define our obsession with the collection of material goods as a form, nay, a replacement, for personality. 
<br><br>
This is all not to say that we should only own 33, or 20,  or any particular amount of clothes items, or that we impose a strict max square footage limit on houses. The latter part of the film really hones in on how people with families and careers manage to live a minimalist lifestyle. The truth is, it does not have to involve going on some individual, spiritualistic "wandering into the desert" type treatment. Instead, there is a key trait of mindfulness and self-affirmation that is key. The affirmation for one to lead a fulfilled life must come not from others or from the goods that one owns, but instead from oneself. I'm sure that many of you have read or watched David Foster Wallace's speech "This is Water", and I think that really touches on the character/cultural trait that we need to embody coming into the future: mindfulness.

I was also struck when Milburn read a passage from his book. Cinematically, that scene was shot beautifully. Milburn stood in the middle of a landscape that is stripped of everything while he speaks of all the different items and clutter that could fill his house. The stark contrast between what he says and where he stands highlights how less is more. When I was watching it, I felt overwhelmed by the description of the items; but when the shot switched back to the minimalist and vast landscape, I felt calm. The empty landscape was relaxing. That is what I think the appeal of minimalism is. When you have less, there is less to worry about, and less to clutter your mind. 
<br><br>
Like you, I also don't plan on putting a strict limit on the amount of things that I own, but I do wish to make sure that everything I own has a meaning. I wish to try and shape my life like how the family at the end lived -- not with limits, but with compromise. We don't have to be the 'ideal' minimalist, but instead we just need to find meaning in everything. When we cut back on quantity and adopt the idea of quality, our economy will hopefully soon follow.
<br><br><hr><br>
I too agree that when I first heard of the idea of Minimalism I was confused as to how people could live with just few items and an empty home. After watching this film I was made aware of the benefits of Minimalism and while I cannot say that I am a Minimalist myself, I can say that I have begun to adopt some of the ideas they expressed in the film. When I was younger I used to love to purchase new shoes, or clothes or random items that I felt like I "needed". As I have gotten older I have slowed down on purchasing unnecessary items as I realized it was getting expensive and taking up space I did not have. While originally my means behind cutting down on my purchases was monetary, I have also realized that a lot of things that I thought I needed I genuinely did not need at all. Going away to college helped me donate items that I did not need and helped me realize how much stuff I was in possession of that I did not actually use. Even though I went through a lot of my stuff while moving to college I still kept things that I thought "I will wear that eventually", I did not. After watching this video and looking at the items I am in possession of at college I still can recognize things that I have not worn nor touched in months. I know that I need to go through my items again, but it is hard getting rid of things especially if they have a memory or event attached to them. While I know that I myself will have a hard time only having the minimum, I know that for our world it would be almost impossible to ask the world to give up their luxury for minimalistic lifestyles.
<br><br>
The idea of Minimalism is great and I believe that if people could live a minimalistic lifestyle than our world would potentially have a chance to recuperate from climate change, only slightly. Our current world has been raised on the ideas of luxury, glorifying the lifestyles of celebrities and striving to have $$$ so that they too could live a life of luxury. People want to drive the hottest, fastest cars, want to live in the biggest mansions, want to own the nicest clothes and shoes and never have to worry about money another day in their lives. Due to this fact I believe it would be immensely hard to convince this world to transition their lifestyles to minimalistic. They would find that thought to be almost a joke, as some might believe their hard work if being put down since they would not be able to spend their hard earned money on what they deserved. While I believe going from a luxurious lifestyle to a completely minimalist one would be almost impossible, I do think it is possible for people to become somewhat of a minimalist and at least cut down on the items that they do not need, cause not only would that save them money it would help save the environment in the long run.

Before watching Minimalism, I questioned why people would want to be minimalist. Having only few items to your named doesn’t sound very fun but after watching, I realized I was wired to want more materialistic items. One could want more and more clothing, gadgets, etc. but will never truly feel happy with what they have and in most cases will just forget about the things we buy and end up throwing them away. The people in the documentary express the happiness they feel after getting rid of most of their belongings because they don’t have much to worry or stress about. 
<br><br>
One part that I felt was was an important topic in the documentary was when they mentioned fast fashion. Fast fashion companies such as Forever 21 and Fashion Nova come out with new articles of clothing almost every week in order to keep up with what’s trendy. This is very detrimental to the the environment due to the amount of resources used to produce the clothing and labor behind what goes into making the articles of clothing. What’s worse is that companies destroy their own clothing afterwards so others cannot resell it which is a complete waste of the clothing. Instead of shopping at these terrible fast fast fashion companies, its better to try to thrift some pieces of clothing at the local thrift shop. Thrifting can now even be done on the internet through Depop which is an app people can sell their clothing through. Companies want us to want to buy stuff in order for them to continue to thrive and make money. We must stray away from our urges to buy more than what we need or have a larger space for living in order for ourselves to have a more stress-free headspace.

After watching “Minimalism,” I had to fight the sudden urge to get rid of half of my belongings. I eyed the clutter on my desk and in my closet and began mentally sorting them into “things I need” and “things I like to have.” If I didn’t have a considerable amount of homework and a paper to write, I probably would’ve tossed out most of the things in my “things I like to have” list. 
<br><br>
I’ve been an active admirer of minimalism for a year or two now, and having followed the documentary’s director Matt D’Avella on YouTube and Instagram has really intrigued me in living a minimalist lifestyle. I never gave much thought on how minimalism and climate change are connected, but after reading a bit of Walden and watching Ken’s videos, I now understand their relationship with each other. As Ken explained, minimalism is not enough on its own, even if the entire world turned minimalist overnight. It’s a good step forward, but what’s really important is paying attention to what you consume and how that impacts the environment. 
<br><br>
I really enjoyed this documentary in particular because it showed me that living a minimalist lifestyle could lead to a life of personal freedom and happiness that a consumer lifestyle could (arguably) never bring. It is promising to see that minimalism is becoming increasingly popular and appealing, and I hope that being conscious of what one consumes comes with it. It only takes a few minutes to research how products you consume affect the environment. 
<br><br>
If everyone could spend that little bit of extra time before deciding on a double-double In N Out burger for lunch versus a homemade garden veggie burger (among many other consumer products we use in our daily lives), I think a significant impact could be made on climate change. This is not to say we should never satisfy our In N Out cravings, but rather be much more mindful of the food we eat, the clothes we buy, and the mode of transportation we use to get to work, just to name a few. These consumer decisions are just as important as voting for politicians that aim to make solid decisions in fighting climate change or changing your diet to reduce (or eliminate) the amount of meat you eat, and I hope that more and more people will adjust their lifestyles for the better of our planet.

 yes, you have very many things!
<br><br><hr><br>
On a more serious note, I agree with you, Enya :) After experiencing doubts in my own habits in life (regarding the amount of “stuff” that I own, of course), your comment really resonated with me.
<br><br>
Since I am currently living in a college residence hall-- surviving in college amidst the beauty of sharing a communal restroom, kitchenette, living space, and lounges-- it is difficult to completely rule out trivial necessities such as Tupperware, clothing, and miscellaneous food items. Perhaps this is just the “you never know when you’ll need it!” mentality that all consumers are guilty of having, but it is absolutely applicable in this case. Or, as I make it out to be.
<br><br>
In any case, “Minimalism” and the two additional short films made me reconsider my ambitions. Instead of hoarding items that I hope will bring me happiness in the future, I would like to make it my personal mission to start living a more minimalist lifestyle- if not a minimalist-ish lifestyle.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really appreciate your thoughtful response to my comment. I definitely agree that it is difficult to pursue a minimalist lifestyle in college, but the least we can do is move towards that kind of lifestyle, even if it's only minimalist-ish :)

Damn, these guys like hugging people. 
<br><br>
Why is it that these guys are suggesting I get rid of almost everything? I totally agree that happiness should not be based on material items, but I really enjoy some things I own and they can boost my happiness. However, I do not feel like I live in too much excess in the first place. I live comfortably in a dorm room with one other person and everything I use and own fits in one closet and one desk with drawers. I do not feel like I am taking up too much space by any means, and I am completely satisfied with what I own. I would not want to throw it away, and I honestly do not think less than what I have would fulfill me any more than I already am. The way this documentary was edited almost felt like I was watching an advertisement. I am sure there are people for who minimalism did not work, but we never got to hear such a story. I agree that everyone should be conscious of their goods usage and try to limit is as much as they comfortably can, but living a true "minimalist lifestyle" like these guys seems unrealistic for every human in America. Showcasing the hugs, the fun "adventurous" travel shots, the uplifting music, and overly idealistic sounding life improvements minimalists went through in this documentary with no real dose of reality makes me doubt the true minimalistic lifestyle. To me, it truly appears depressing and empty, and I would not be able to focus on living a sustainable lifestyle in other ways feeling uncomfortable and sad in my living space.

I definitely see where you’re coming from, quintessential minimalism is not a lifestyle for everyone. Some people may find it depressing or constricting, but I think that minimalism is subjective to an individual and their situation. Just like the father with eight children in the film, he practices an extent of minimalism but a version adjusted to his family. The minimalism that the two men in the film were practicing and the minimalism that the father integrates into his large family are very different, but the common ideology is that consumers are conscious of their purchases and are aware of their own necessities. I don’t think the two men were necessarily advertising that you should get rid of everything. For them specifically, minimalism means that they carry less in all aspects of their lives. Josh is a single man, so he really only needs his basics. Ryan practices minimalism in a similar way to Josh, but he lives with his girlfriend who “loves her shoes” and might not be at all on the same level that her significant other is, but there is compromise in their relationship. I think that is one of the most important takeaways for me from this film. It is that being minimalist does not mean that you can not love the things that bring joy into your life. I, too, was thinking, how could I ever be a minimalist if I want to keep shelves of books in my house when I’m a homeowner? Then, right after this went through my mind,  my thoughts were appeased because Ryan went on in one of his talks to say that if it has value to you then keep it! I think minimalism can be practiced to any extent and not necessarily to the extremes that Josh and Ryan have adopted it; the important thing is that one keeps the things that have the most value to them and are very mindful of the purchases they make, so as to not fall into a cycle of mind-numbing consumption to fill voids in other aspects of one’s life. To me personally, minimalism seems like a freeing way because I can acknowledge where i have excess in my life and I’d like to adjust my lifestyle to align with some of its central ideas. But maybe for you, you do not experience too much excess and I think that alone is an aspect of minimalism, and doesn’t insinuate that you need to start downsizing your things.
<br><br><hr><br>
This is a very valid argument and if you believe your current situation is good for your living than you should not make any changes. If it's not broke don't fix it. Yet you can still evaluate your materials individually and view if they have value to you. If they do that’s great keep it, but if you think you could live without it then donate it or something. Honestly the main point of the video was to find your happiness and if you’ve accomplished that than don’t change. I think that people should do as they please, but if your not happy than you should try to make changes and taking out stuff that doesn’t add value to your life is a start. I do believe the filmmakers are probably only focusing on the positives, but I do believe the guys were genuinely happy and wanted to make a change, plus they had a purpose which is part of living a happy life. But I do agree that materialism is not what happiness should be based on, since it should be based on family, friends, hobbies, and having a purpose. Anyway my point is that you should do what makes you happy, but trying things never hurts and that materialism doesn't lead to happiness.

“We are wired to be dissatisfied” is a quote from Minimalism that really resonated with me. My email inbox is flooded everyday with messages from brands like Fashion Nova, Pretty Little Thing, and Princess Polly, all telling me that I need an update to my wardrobe. They all attach photos of beautiful girls in trendy pieces of fashion, enticing me to click on “Shop Now” to fulfill my worldly desires of clothes. My closet in my apartment is flooded with everything a girl could need: plenty of jeans, jackets, tops, sweaters, and even accessories. Yet, when I receive these emails, I still continue to click on “Shop Now” and add to my collection of clothing. My apartment has a shoe closet, where my roommates and I place our footwear, and my section is swamped with sneakers, slip-ons, and boots. I have everything I need and more, though I still continue to yearn for costly updates to my wardrobe. I was shocked to see that so many people partook in the “333 Project,” wearing thirty three articles of clothing for three months. Watching many young women be able to complete this challenge made me rethink the bulk in my closet. If I’m being completely honest, I probably have at least 150 pieces of clothing, ranging from numerous tops to all the different styles of jeans that I own. 
<br><br>
I believe these are the effects of our country’s capitalist society. American culture is upgrading from a humble house to a McMansion. This creates an underlying discontent with everything that we have, craving more “things” to fill the holes in our lives. Companies’ mass advertising influences a materialistic lifestyle, always wanting to buy the next big thing, driving the cost of fast fashion downwards, as well as the labor wage to those who make our clothing. I truly believe that Ken’s statement, “Minimalism is a first-world solution to a first-world problem” is completely accurate. As a society, we simply cannot cut out all of the luxuries we have. Thus, cutting back on our privileges is a step towards the right direction. I am doubtful that the majority of people living in first world countries will agree to switch to this lifestyle, but it definitely should be encouraged.

Lol, I too have emails flooded with clothing snd shoe ads with a lot of stuff I would actuallly like to own. I also have closet full of clothes, definelty more than what I need and I have a bit of snekaer problem as I am a sneakerhead with excessive pairs of expensive sneakers. I rrealize that my current lifestyle is in no way sustainable and I could definetly improve on being more smart and sustainable with my purchases. Minimalism looked pretty cool, and I didn’t expect to feel like that. It looked so simple and instead of just having lots of things you had few important things that meant a lot to you because everything you serves a purpose. I was so drawn to that idea. However, I know for a fact that making that tranistion for myself would be immensly difficult. 
<br><br>
Minimilism is a great idea, however, in terms of nationwide acceptance I share in your doubts. I thinl far too many have alreayd comitted themselves to materialism and the idea of having the biggest house with the nicest or fastest car and a closet full of designer clothes, Americans love to flex.

“Minimalism” was a film was entertaining, yet educational. In the past, I’ve seen many videos of minimalists who live in compact homes (trailers). I always thought it was so fascinating, but I never stopped to think about why they live that lifestyle. After finishing the film, I realized how materialistic our society has become. Even young children own expensive items such as iPads and iPhones, and they’re pressured to grow up wearing expensive, stylish clothing. One point that was brought up during the film was that we never stop craving for more. Humans are innately hardwired to strive for contentment. However, the misconception is that buying material items will help us reach that very contentment. We just don’t realize that it’s fleeting and does not last long. The major takeaway from this film is that we take up more space than we need to. People continuously buy large houses, new clothing, and luxurious cars. What I like to say is it’s just buying stuff to fill stuff with more stuff. Ultimately, most of our stuff is unnecessary, yet we need it to keep us happy. I definitely agree with a minimalist lifestyle because it’s eco-friendly and even cost-efficient. It seems extremely hard to adapt to it only because it’s so different, but it’s not impossible.

I too have always been fascinated by the idea of compact homes. Interestingly enough, it seems as if they are becoming more and more popular among young adults. I remember watching another documentary once on these homes and, similar to many of the interviews in Minimalism, the people who chose to live this way were ultimately seeking ways to be happier outside of a constructed lifestyle standard. I really like the way you word excessive consumption as “buying stuff to fill stuff with more stuff” because that’s exactly how I would picture someone with a large house looking to make all the space fulfill a purpose in comparison to a person in a compact home with the basic necessities for living. 
<br><br>
I think that this week’s lecture and film tie into one another perfectly because they have made me consider what it means to live within the expectations of a consumer economy and how knowledgeable we actually are about the production of the things we buy. It is quite difficult to imagine oneself living a minimalist lifestyle while still partaking in consumerism, but seeing as it is becomingly increasingly popular for a lot of reasons, including personal happiness and sustainability, it would not take much effort to begin to be diligent about our choices as consumers.

The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," was a great watch, and gave me lots of inspiration to simplify and de-clutter my own life. For example, they shared a story about Colin Wright, an LA branding agency executive who left his consumerist lifestyle and consolidated his belongings into just 51 items. This really made me begin to think about all the unnecessary "stuff" that I have in my own life whether it be clothing, furniture or just living space in general. What really sold me about this example was how happy and content that Colin seemed as he shared his transition to minimalism. He, as well as most of the other "minimalists" in the film, appeared to live very low stress, enjoyable lives, and that really made me believe that these lifestyle choices were not only responsible and economical, but ultimately could lead to a better quality of life too.

In response to Ken's question about whether or not we can get enough people to convert to more minimal lifestyles, I look to the shift that Ryan and Joshua went through in the film, leaving highly consumerist lifestyles to live with much less. I think that they are great examples of a people who made a big shift when they converted to living a minimalist lifestyle, and they show that this type of transition is possible for anyone to make. In watching the film and from my own experience, I know that this type of transition to minimalism can't take place all at once, but there are already so many examples in our world of people going against the maximalist culture, such those who have "downsized" to live in micro-apartments, or those who own only a few outfits of clothing. These types of trends make me believe that possibly one day we will all live like this, whether by our own choice or as some sort of necessity due to our changing planet.

I also believe that the film on minimalism provided good insight on how to declutter your life. I think it is very relevant for people who are stuck working 9-5 desk jobs making good money but not really enjoying their work. By decluttering your life, you can reflect and get a glimpse on what is really important to you which I believe in turn brings you closer to who you are. Thus, if you are blind consumer minalims can help bring you closer to who you are while simultaneously helping the climate crisis. Unfortunately, I really don't see people giving up the consumer lifestyles because after all our entire economy is built upon that very lifestyle. This is why I believe that the solution will have to come from technology and government regulations that give sustainable companies an advantage.

The most significant element presented in Minimalism, in my opinion, was the extraordinary variance in terms of how different people approach minimalism. I think that the description of forming your own “template” for consumption is an interesting concept. The “American Dream” has definitely set an unsustainable precedent for the average family. In order to combat that, though, different people are taking different approaches. For some, the main emphasis is on downsizing living space. I didn’t realize how large the average home is today compared with in the past. I was not surprised, though, that many people have opted for “tiny houses” more recently. In fact, I’ve had extended conversations with friends about traveling across the country and living in a van. I think that it’s a really good thing that people are able to practice minimalism in their own way. The idea of drastically reducing consumption can scare a lot of people so, by acknowledging the large spread of different sorts of minimalism, I think they will continue to reach a broader audience.
<br><br>
More importantly, the analysis of materialism as a philosophy was extremely interesting to me. By emphasizing the inherent value of a smaller amount of things, people will actually value what they have more and can do so in a positive way if they take this “materialistic” approach. Speaking to Ken’s comments on the film I actually maintain, similarly to some of my comments about energy, that the philosophical approach will be the most effective in the long-run. If we can shift the way people think about what they own, even broadly, I agree that they will value what they have and even each-other more.

The film “Minimalism” demonstrates the excessive consumerism existing within our society. As mentioned in the film, American culture perpetuates an unachievable lifestyle through an illusion created by social media. People live with constant dissatisfaction when the items they own are out of trend. Moreover, people tend to throw away clothes when they are no longer fashionable or in trend instead of throwing them away because they are no longer usable. A more popular example is when there is a huge crowd of people lined up for the new iphone release. There are some people who will buy a new phone even if they just recently purchased one. Consumerism, therefore, is a big part of climate change because resources are wasted instead of reused. We should be taking into consideration the resources we are wasting when purchasing new items. People also buy enormous homes, but they do not utilize all their space. The film explained how owning a smaller space is more affordable and sustainable which is better environmentally. Although not everyone will agree with significantly reducing the size of their home, I think people should attempt to make less wasteful purchases.

The film minimalism impresses me a lot. It says imagine we do subtraction to our life, there would be less chaos, less pressure, and less anxiety so that we would have more time to do more meaningful things and relations. In this way, we may get more growth and satisfaction in our life rather than simply pursue materialistic life.
<br><br>
 We need to make some change when we think the rich in material is the rich in mind. It is important for us to focus on what we really need and what really weighted in life.
 <br><br><hr><br>
 I strongly agree with you. Nowadays, people all around the world are adopted to the living style of “Consumerism.” I think for the reason why many people wasted the things after they purchased, such as house or phones as you mentioned, is that people bought these goods not for their materially meaning but for their symbolic meaning. For example, some people may decide to purchase a piece of jewelry not for they are beautiful, but they can demonstrate their owner’s supreme status. Because of the cheapness and convenience, buying things started to become an addiction for people, however, they seldom receive satisfaction and happiness from their actions, and at the same time, the manufactures contributed to the climate crisis.
<br><br> 
Also, in the film, a former Wall-Street Broker, AJ Leon’s life experience was mentioned. In the past, he related whether a person is successful in how many zeroes he has at the end of his paycheck. Therefore, when he chose his major he referred to a book which listed all majors’ degree versus earning potential overtime and chose the major Finance and Accounting. However, when he eventually worked at Wall-Street, earning high wages, getting a promotion by his boss, he finally realized that his life’s meaning is not money but freedom. For this purpose, he decided to leave his job and lived as a minimalist. His experience touched me. It can be effectively linked to the idea that “many people living the minimalism lifestyle not only for environmental purpose but also for finding their freedom” which is mentioned in the lecture. “Living for stuff wasn’t living at all.” To find true happiness and freedom, they shouldn’t be bothered by all the materials around them, but finding the things they are interested in and meaningful to their lives.
 <br><br>
Consumerism leads to manufacturing, which then contributed to a great amount of emission of greenhouse gas that caused global climate changes. For both the environment as well as themselves, it is necessary for people to abandoned “Consumerism,” and give the “Minimalism” life-style a try.

Ryan and Josh did a great job of transferring an efficient and meaningful thought: to be
minimalism. The most debatable question in this thought will still be will material bring happiness
or not? I would say I really do not know. I am not rich enough to have the qualification to say that material world will make people feel less happy. I know in the videos and in the movie " Minimalism", and from lots of famous people's perspective, it is more satisfactory and happier to have more time to be with friends and families, to do more more meaningful things. However, maybe some of them are rich enough to feel it or they were just using the research from the rich. I personally believe that lots of people want to be rich even if there are more problems of being rich. Firstly, we need to be rich enough to talk about if we can waste money or materials or not, or these are all bluffing. I can only say that I will not waste money on many " fashions" myself and it is always good to do so. Anyway, loving the environment is the right way.

I appreciated how this documentary began with clips of shoppers on Black Friday scrambling over one another to get the newest good. The documentary then quickly shifts to pan over a luscious, green countryside. These two scenes are in stark contrast to each other and in a way represent the main point of the documentary; letting go of material goods can make us happier, freer and more environmentally sustainable. This documentary opened my eyes to just how much we consume on a day to day basis, sometimes without even realizing it. We live in a culture with rampant consumerism and excessive materialism. This culture is being encouraged by advertisements. Today, advertisements are everywhere and I was amazed to learn that we see roughly five thousand advertisements each day. It is really hard for me to imagine any other way of life. Even though most human beings throughout history have gotten by with only things that are needed to sustain. Moreover, at least 80% of the world’s population lives on less than $10 a day. 
<br><br>
I found it interesting that as long as we have enough money to meet our basic needs, more money does not contribute to happiness. Despite this, people are working more than ever to make money and buy more goods because people believe that these things goods will make them happier and more fulfilled. This leads to a self-perpetuating cycle in which people work to purchase goods and then they feel a void in their life so they work more to buy more goods and it continues. What people fail to realize is that materialism makes us less happy, more anxious, depressed, and more surface. Minimalism is a valid option to combat this vicious cycle.

I had heard of minimalism a few times before, but this film really put into perspective the impact simplified living can have on people's lives. In the film, they stated "As humans we're wired to become dissatisfied," and this is what I feel is at the source of most of humankind's problems. This insatiable greed that's perpetuated by mass consumerism, infinite advertisements, and the continuous development and manufacturing of unnecessary things, encourages society almost to a point of entrapment, into thinking we always need more. Instead of paying more for 1 thing that's going to last a very long time, people are sucked in to industries that are making things cheaper, more available, and lower quality. Compulsory consumption is a huge problem with direct effects on the climate crisis, if not a source problem. As mentioned in the film, people have this "idea of success" that they build their whole lives around, never stopping to consider there may be other more satisfying definitions of success and different paths of attaining it. I feel like the world's biggest marketing ploy is their loaded version of "success." We are conditioned from the day we are born to believe in their definition of success. Education equals jobs equals money equals THINGS equals success. There is nothing wrong with the first two steps, however it's how we are motivated by the last steps which corrupts our efforts at the first two. Take the man in the film for example, he researched what fields guarantee the highest paying jobs and chose solely off that. After getting his dream job as a junior partner he realized this had never been his dream, but a social construct of the idealized "American dream". People realize too late that money and things will never provide lasting happiness. I recently read a passage that said, "Why seek joy through the intermediary of material pleasures and objects? Why not seek joy directly?" By living simply in every sense of the word, I feel we are forced to look for happiness in the most raw sense. We stop our humiliating chase from one desire to the next and learn what is truly essential in our lives, ultimately finding joy in simplicity

I really enjoyed this film, and I definitely hope the concept of minimalism becomes more mainstream. One of the things Ryan mentioned was "keep what makes you happy". I feel like this was an important rule to live by because if more people understood that de-cluttering is not about getting rid of everything, and more about getting rid of things that are a waste of space, time, or energy, then they would be more open to the idea of minimalism. More recently, the Netflix show "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" gained popularity, and the same idea was repeated; to keep things that "spark joy". This inspired many people to reorganize their lives, including my mother, who donated a bunch of clothes, books, and dishes. At first my siblings were reluctant, but after a while, none of us felt the absence of the things we had gotten rid of - proof that they were just a waste of space. Decluttering has been beneficial in so many ways: we no longer have to look through a bunch of stuff to find what we're looking for, washing the dishes and clothes takes less time, cleaning up the home is easier, and we don't waste a lot of time thinking about things like what we should wear.
<br><br>
One of the comments in the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," that really struck me was Juliet Schor claiming that the American Dream "started out as a concept that was more about opportunity" but now "what it means to have achieved the American Dream in the United States has increased tremendously in material terms". I completely agree with this statement. In present society, I notice a lot of people equate happiness to tangible possessions, and I feel like that's a problem especially in my generation, where people focus on material objects far too much. I remember in my high school there was a club on campus for hypebeasts, and a good number of pages from our yearbook were dedicated to pictures of the seniors alongside the cars they drove. I watch many of my friends spend money on things they don't need - things they KNOW they don't need - but buy anyway because it'll give them a boost on the popularity ladder and that will make them happy, but only for a limited amount of time. The reason why I love the concept of minimalism is because while you are getting rid of some things, you are also subconsciously getting rid of your need to be validated based on those things, and that is what keeps you content for the long term.

I thought of the Marie Kondo show as well during this documentary. I thought it did a really good job of embodying the idea that Josh had about consumption being fine, but not compulsory consumption. Things like the Kon-Marie method or Project 333 help us be more conscientious about our belongings and how they serve us, and I think these would be really helpful for people of all ages to practice. I've noticed while many of our generation are willing to be more minimalist in some aspects, there is still a large connection between materialism and social status: fashion trends are in as quickly as they are out, and fast-fashion sites like FashionNova, Romwe, and Zaful are still really common places for people to buy trendy clothing that they only wear a couple times to keep up with fashion and snap a couple pictures in. While we might not be focused on massive houses, lots of decorative furniture, or workaholic culture like people in "Minimalism" were, we still do focus a lot on what our clothes and the things we own say about us. 
<br><br>
On the flip-side, I feel like people of our generation are not as focused on having large and elegant houses, which is good. As Ken mentioned last week, young people are more willing to live in smaller spaces and in cities instead of suburbs. It shocked me to hear that people only walk frequently in 40% of the space in their large homes, and when I think about my own patterns of places I spend time at in my parents house, I notice none of us spend a lot of time in the large amount of living space my parents were so insistent on. Having such a large space makes it difficult to be deliberate in your decisions to own certain items; it's easier to justify buying something new or not donating it if you know you'll have a space to keep it. I think as people move more into cities and smaller living spaces, minimalism will be a much easier principle to live by.

"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was a refreshing watch after watching the past few films and reading the last couple of week's articles. Both Walden and Minimalism don't center around the environment, yet they are both crucial in creating solutions to the problem we currently face. In Minimalism, both of the guys were drawn to Minimalism at very low points in their life. Through minimalism, they were able to take better care of themselves and learn to be happy. Both of them were "successful" in the eyes of society, but felt terrible inside. This goes to show that minimalism isn't a trend, it's not a solution for those already facing poverty to feel better about themselves, this is a real solution to the rat race that is American consumerism. Conveniently, it is also a partial solution to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
By practicing minimalism, we will not only be able to better ourselves, but we will also be able to help the planet in this time of disaster. One of the most prominent components of the causes of climate change is the human population's consumerism habits. If it would be possible to have a significant percentage of the citizens of first world countries partake in minimalism, we would see huge changes in the health of the human population and the planet.

I definitely found this documentary refreshing too after all that we have been reading and watching. I love how this documentary gave us a "new recipe" to life. They are not discrediting the American Dream, but rather offering a different view that some can choose to follow. I found particular interest in the fact that bother Joshua and Ryan lived similar lives in the idea of the career "rat race". This was  important because we as college students will soon enter this world and more than likely experience it for ourselves. I just found it sad that Joshua only decided to change his life after his mother passing and his divorce. However, that experience changed his life forever and his message to the world is definitely one that I think many Americans participating in the rat race today will take interest too. On top of that, it is great that this method of minimalism does help each individual contribute their part in living a sustainable life for the better of our planet.

Indeed, materialism has influenced our values since childhood. Its influence is so powerful that we have the idea that we get happiness, respect, and status by buying things from a young age. And minimalism is its antonym. I am glad that many people are aware of the problem of materialism and have put forward minimalism corresponding to it. But I think it's difficult to change people's views on consumption and make people reduce their consumption. No one will deny that when they get a new item, they always show a happy expression instead of a sad expression. Knowing your own value in the video to reduce the impact of materialism on you is a perhaps effective solution. Because there is some value that cannot be obtained through purchase. Some people are looking for an ordinary, simple and quiet life, which is not brought by consumption. But I think that the main reason for discovering your intrinsic value is not to contradict materialism but to recognize what you prefer and what your life is like. If someone really has the intrinsic value to make themselves better through consumption, then others have no right to scorn him/her.

This film was valuable for me in that it forced me to do a lot of thinking about my life and the lives of my family and friends. I realize I am on the life track that many of the voices in the film warn of. I am uber focused on getting good grades so that I can go to a good law school and become a lawyer and make a lot of money. This isn’t the main reason I want to become a lawyer but I am still following the script. This film scared me because it forced me to think about whether the American dream and my dream are the same. In actuality, the American dream has so many drawbacks: those pursuing it are constantly zoned in on getting the next promotion, buying a better car, buying a nicer house, etc. We live in a world ruled by this addiction for stuff and this idea that if you buy enough stuff you will eventually find happiness. Obviously, this isn’t true and this is what minimalism is based off of. I don’t know if I will ever be able to go full minimalist, but minimalism is a wonderful school for how to live one’s life. As shown in the film, it brings less clutter, less stress, less obsession, less conflict, etc. Minimalism would largely benefit the people in our country and our country as a whole in a variety of ways if a sizeable amount of Americans really bought into the concept.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” shares the value of being minimalism, and this is the first time I heard the idea of Minimalism. Material possessions can make us happy, but it also harms. It is impossible or hard to turn everyone to be minimalism, to say that you cannot use the money you make to buy whatever you want, but it is a nice value to say that instead of purchasing lots and lots of stuff, we need to buy something sustainable. Minimalism has plenty of merits, related to economical, emotional, and environmental aspects. These videos convinced me that minimalism is a very important factor in the solution of climate crisis. These items you purchased cannot really make you happy, it is yourself who need to enrich your life.

In contrast, I have heard of the idea of minimalism as my roommate had used that term to describe herself when we were first moving in together. I  own many more things than she does and had to change that once experiencing living with two other people in such a small room. It wasn’t until after I watched this documentary that I really started to think and ask the questions: “Is everything that I have meaningful? Do I use everything that I have often”. The answers to both of those questions is a big NO. Watching this documentary ensued a turning point in how I want to live my life and that the clutter is truly overwhelming. I disagree with the comment you made that it’s “impossible” to influence others in the same way that I was. I think if we use the media to our advantage we can make this difference with consuming less and what is actually needed. I also think it’s very important in thinking positively about the situation and at least try our best to converting to a minimalist lifestyle. 
<br><br>
 Within the refreshing and eye opening documentary, I noticed that all of their homes still had that “homey” feeling to them and even without all of the extra “stuff” they are able to raise kids, feel happy, and have enough. This really resonated with me because I always felt like you have to have lots of stuff inside your house to feel comfortable but it looks like otherwise. I think it was also important that within the documentary they weren’t necessarily trying to make everyone to change to this lifestyle. They were simply just demonstrating what their experience has been and I think that was influential within itself. People tend to listen or actually take into account of what one is saying if they aren’t pressured into doing so. Overall, I think that switching to this lifestyle will not only benefit our wellbeing but the environment’s as well because the less we consume the less that we will use the large industries to produce.
<br><br><hr><br>
"Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" made me take a step back and question my own choices. It made me realize just how many things I own that I do not use; this culture of consumerism pushes people to the belief that owning something even if you don't need it is better than not owning it. This obsession with possessing things is one of the direct causes of the climate crisis. Though it is mostly the fault of big oil companies and corrupt leaders, we as a generation must step back and limit ourselves in indulging on every whim. The documentary's message proves to be a much less radical, and entirely doable solution to curbing climate crisis. It shows the importance of not only stopping the direct causes f climate crisis, but also the decisions and motivations that led to over pollution in the first place. It was certainly  eye opening to see the lifestyle of  minimalism. Joshua possessing only what he need was shocking to me at first, but upon further analysis proves to be very logical. Although correct in the message, I feel that the audience should not be pressured to live as minimalists to the extreme. The message of the documentary was to tell its viewers to be more mindful of their actions rather than cutting them cold turkey.

This movie made me think about how many things I own in relation to what I use on a regular basis. I like to consider myself fairly conservative in terms of what I buy and use regularly. (I am a 4th year and still wear some of my shirts from high school). With that being said, it made me think about other aspects of my life and ambitions. I am entering the workforce soon, and already thinking about how I can make a 6 figure salary as quickly as possible. It made me question why I want this, which ultimately boils down to being able to buy a nice car and house. 
<br><br>
 I have never thought that money can buy happiness, however I do believe that not having money can lead to stress and ultimately can lower ones overall quality of life. I thought that the movie did not disregard this point, and actually embraced it. I loved the evaluation of how much value each thing brought to your life. I might do this in my room soon, and donate what I deem not as important. 
 <br><br>
 If the materialistic orientation of our everyday life were to cease, I believe that it could drastically change the per capita ecological footprint that america possesses. To make a difference, it would require massive systematic changes, from the everyday citizen. People would need to be willing and able to ignore the systematic targeted advertising embedded in our society, and find other coping methods to life than materialism.

I also consider myself to be fairly conservative with what I buy and own. I think growing up in a low-income household made that easier because I couldn’t go out and buy everything I wanted, and I’ve always taken great care of my things and held on to the essentials. I do love shopping, but many of my shoes and clothes are hand-me-downs from my older sisters, and I never go overboard at the mall. Fun fact, I wore the same uniforms all throughout highschool, and the only new uniform piece I bought was the senior sweatshirt. 
<br><br>
Anyway, I enjoyed this film, and watching the black friday footage was embarrassing to say the least, especially because I love black friday. I don’t think of myself as owning too much stuff, but I bet I can also get rid of things that don’t hold value to me. One of my favorite quotes in the film was when someone said humans are “wired to become dissatisfied” which I find very true, and sad. 
<br><br>
One of the biggest problems I see is fast fashion, but also the cost of clothing. I know fast fashion is a problem and that the clothes are cheap because they are mass produced in sweatshops, which is unethical and terrible for the environment, but they are cheap. Which makes people buy them. Especially people who are lower-income. I can speak from personal experience, as I shop at Forever 21 and the sale racks at Hollister, Urban Outfitters, and Zara. I also thrift, and I will start thrifting more, but being environmentally conscious is a bit more difficult for people who are broke. 
<br><br>
I also think it’ll be extremely difficult to dismantle the consumerist society we live in. I don’t even think I would be able to live a minimalist lifestyle. But we must try.

I watched Minimalism last quarter so I watched the short Youtube films: "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism." 
<br><br>
"Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" was extremely interesting. The opening sentence of the film stated how in the 1970s, scientists predicted that the "overuse of planetary resources" by humans would take into effect in the beginning of the 21st century. Some of the harmful effects included food prices skyrocketing, pollution destabilizing the planet, and the US losing over 8 million jobs. In addition, over 44 million people in the US were on food stamps, yet 5% of the population had 65% of the country's wealth. I liked how this short film focused specifically on why the US should decrease the amount of working hours per week. The video explained that Americans need to take a break, especially with the working hours increasing by 200 hours a year since the 1970s, and this causes more stress among families and less harmony. When there are less work hours, it encourages a DIY mindset and decreases consumerism, as proven in the Netherlands.
<br><br>
"The High Price of Materialism" focused more on how commercialization and consumerism work together to encourage the wealthy to surround themselves with various products.This tends to lead to high levels of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, as these levels tend to be common among people who value "the aims encouraged by consumerist society." Furthermore, when people focus too excessively on materialism, they end up caring less about the Earth. The video encourages us to promote intrinsic values to grow as a person among our families and friends to improve the broader world, as countries such as France and Britain are prioritizing well-being of their citizens over financial growth and GDP. Both of these videos were interesting and brought a new perspective of how consumerism is affecting our everyday habits, as well as how we can fix our current lifestyles towards being environmentally friendly.

I also watched the two short films, "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism" because I watched “Minimalism” last year in english 22. I enjoyed the film, “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy '' because it was very informative on how we can build a social capital rather than to be stuck in a borrow/spend consumer culture. I found it interesting that the video opened with the fact that in the 1970’s scientists predicted that the overuse of planetary resources would come into effect during the 21st century and have many harmful effects such as people losing their jobs. With this being said, we needed to build a new economic model and way of living to reduce ecological impacts and create more jobs. Since this time (1970) working hours rose to 200 hours per year which in turn boosted carbon emissions. Due to this, there was a need to reduce the amount of hours each individual works, which has shown to have positive effects. When I originally heard that we needed to cut back on working hours, I thought this was a stupid idea, but it makes more sense now after watching this video. Not only will cutting back on hours reduce carbon emissions, it will also lead individuals to happier, less stressful lives. It also allows them to spend more time on living creatively because it will give them more time to try “diy” trends such as building their own low cost homes, making their own clothes, and growing their own crops. This in turn means that when people work less, they consume less. 
<br><br>
I personally enjoyed the second film, “The High Price of Materialism” more than the first. I found it very interesting to stats on how materialism affects people and their everyday lives. Overall, materialism is shown to lower an individual's happiness and satisfaction which leads to depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. I can personally relate to this effect because I always feel guilty/dissatisfied when consuming more. Whenever I buy something at the mall, I always second guess myself afterwards. I think to myself whether or not it was a good idea to spend my own working money on this item rather than enjoying the thought of it. I found it interesting when the video mentioned the relation to the seesaw effect. Materialism is like a seesaw in that, as materialistic values go up, social values go down. Another example of this was as materialism goes up, focusing on caring for the earth goes down. The main question in this video however, was how to develop ways to diminish materialistic ways? This is something I believe will be extremely challenging (even for myself), but I believe it is necessary to do. Instead of spending money on unnecessary things, we need to focus on spending time with friends/family, taking walks, getting fresh air, etc. By doing these things, we are able to distract ourselves from consuming. Personally, when I’m at home and I am bored, I will go to the mall “for fun”. This leads to me buying items I don’t really need. The fact of materialism seems inescapable but if we find a way to reduce it, we will be able to live a happier life.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree; I also thought that it would be absurd to cut working hours, since people need at least a somewhat stable income to survive and support their families. It's really interesting that cutting working hours would actually benefit families as a whole because the family members working can spend more time with their children and other relatives. I also do like how the video mentioned the possible growth of "DIY" models, and how family members can invest more time learning how to utilize sustainable methods such as growing crops. 
<br><br>
I also thought that "The High Price of Materialism" was personally more relevant and impactful for our generation, since many people in our society are so invested towards buying the latest model of the iPhone, or other items and products that are on the trend. It's really sad to see that many people stop caring about the earth because they are too focused on their personal gains; I like the seesaw analogy as well, since it accurately explains the negative effects of high materialism.

This film provides a perspective that a life not tied to material things is possible, attainable, and honestly should be desirable. The two authors of Minimalism were right not to be overly preachy by pushing their message, but rather informing people about the steps they can take to live a more simple life, a life that can declutter their living spaces and their minds. To get to a society, at least in American culture, in which the majority live minimalist lives, there needs to be a shift in the amount of products and advertisements that plague our lives, since we see thousands of ads every day through our phones and other multimedia outlets. I am not sure where this change is going to come from, maybe government putting a limit on the amount of content the typical person is exposed to to try to decrease our exposure to such demands. I do think that a large enough movement could inspire a change in lifestyle choices, such as increased awareness of how the fast fashion industry impacts people and the environment, and inspire people to live more fulfilling lives with the knowledge that cutting some things out of our daily routine or removing certain possessions can decrease anxieties and other thoughts/situations that can lead to depression.
<br><br>
Even though the two authors of Minimalism emphasized that this is not necessarily a radical lifestyle, I think many people probably perceive this that way. There needs to be a continual fight and effort to bring information to light of the possibility of a healthier way of living, that may or may not be the best fit for everyone. Watching Ken’s video did bring thoughts of inequality to mind as he discussed the idea of minimalism as a choice because people that are less privileged or fortunate already do not have much autonomy over what they can buy. Although I love the idea of living more on less, and I plan to cut more things out of my life that do not add value or bring me happiness, I think that those who have less freedom of choice or who struggle to provide for themselves and their families can look at well-off people who choose to own less as very privileged to make those decisions since they have the opportunity to provide more for themselves but choose to live humbler lives (but I cannot speak for anyone on this topic nor do I know where each individual stands). I hope we can see a culture shift soon, and it may as well start at the individual level.

After watching both “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” and “The High Price of Materialism” I do believe that voluntary minimalists must be some of the happiest people on Earth.  The video mentions that people who are more materialistic are usually unhappier, and insecure.  Yet for some reason, for most of us, it seems impossible to be able to live a life without needing material to be happy.  The Plenitude economy is a very interesting concept and it would be smart to seriously consider if we want to develop a healthier lifestyle for both ourselves and the planet.  The way it was explained in the video makes it seem completely doable, but it still seems extremely out of reach, like some sort of fantasy land.  I think the reason is seems so out of reach is because, like Ken said, minimalism is usually a personal choice.  The video also does a good job pointing out the problems of our current economy and why we should consider changing it.  It was also beneficial to include examples of other countries that live with a similar economy and have succeeded in doing so. This shows that if the US were to adopt a Plenitude economy there is room to thrive.

I agree in that Plentitude Economy is a very interesting idea. The way we spend our time being able to effect environmental impact, the economy, job creation, and much more is mind boggling to me. If it's that simple, why haven't we already made the switch, especially if it will boost overall happiness? Minimalism has a misconception in the U.S. because if people are wealthy enough to not live minimally, why would they? They could buy whatever they wanted and get "joy" out of consuming. However these people, who are unfortunately the majority of the U.S., don't see the indirect relationship between happiness and consumerism. As one consumes more, they tend to become less happy. If everyone was informed of the concept of a plentitude economy, and if we started seeing more communities practicing this concept, I believe the practice would be widely accepted and implemented. Most likely the richest people won't practice this concept, but it is important to show that a plentitude economy can work and has greater results than the economy we see today.
<br><br><hr><Br>
Similarly to you, I found that the videos did a very good job at making the minimalist lifestyle seem appealing in such a short and sweet format. I feel that many insecurities in my life, and others from what I've observed, were birthed from materialism. My worth as a person was tied to my worth monetarily. There are times wherein I feel like I'm a fraud for promoting frugality, minimalism, and other things, yet not fully fulfilling them myself in some ways. In that way, a plenitude economy provides a gateway out of that mindset as it allows for a system wherein respect in tied into the society. However, the likelihood of that coming into fruition is minimal at the moment. Every level of society, from the wealthiest to the poorest, needs to work together to allow for a shift in how happiness is observed. As "The High Price of Materialism" stated, the good life is now associated with the goods life. But I hold hope that the country, and maybe even the world, will be able to see the consequences that living our free lifestyle has at the moment, in order to adopt concepts, like the plenitude economy.

Minimalism is a word that opposites to consumerism. Since we are overexploiting the resources of the planet, we have to embrace a new lifestyle to avoid going to extinction. As Ken mentioned, we are in the sixth extinction, and we need to take action to mitigate the climate crisis. The simplest way is just to purchase less, a lot less. Furthermore,  in the video "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy", it told us that working hours have risen 200 hours a year which will create lots of stress on the workers. Also, there are many unemployed people who can only sustain their life by doing part-time jobs. The video proposed a feasible suggestion which is to decrease the worktime and hire more employees. It is a way that both benefits workers and unemployed people. In addition, people will have time to build low cost and eco-friendly houses by growing some plants and manufacturing some items. This proposal can effectively cut CO2 emissions, because people will buy less if they have more leisure time.
<br><br>
     Moreover, people in American were taught that consumerism is related to happiness. In fact, consumerism is inversely proportional to happiness. Therefore, the more people buy, the more unhappy they are. There is a simple way to make people happy, which is mentioned in the video " The high price of materialism", which is to improve one's intrinsic value by helping others. It can not only make people happy, but it can also diminish the impact of materialism on people. However, the thought of consumerism may be formed because of the advertisements of many goods on TV. These Ads are somewhat brain-washing, and children are easily impacted by them. Only if there are enough people to be aware of this crisis, the problem can be solved. If people manage to counteract the climate crisis, minimalism is a good way to start.

I have been wondering why people in the films that I watched in last quarter’s ENGL22 say that economic growth is the cause of those environmental problems. I guess this week’s film materials provide me with the answers. Before watching them, I thought that the growth is hurting the Earth because we keep exploiting from it. However, now, it seems that it’s not about the materials, but more about how we think about the earth. “Consumerism” referred to in the video is an example of what is the worst way to gain happiness from our earth. When mentioning the term “consume”, as an Econ-major student, I always think about GDP, a measurement of the economy and the standard of living, and we calculate GDP with people’s spending. Why? Why we calculate people’s standard of living with the sum of the spending. This is like an indirect inferring that our lives are going to be better if we have more power to consume and purchase, but does buying more clothes or cars actually make people’s standard of living improve? Or maybe we can improve our standard of living by study more, by knowing more, by enjoying nature more? Just like what has been suggested in the videos. 
<br><br>
Earth is not a place for us to take. Earth is a place for us to share. Share with other human beings. Share with other living things. True happiness shouldn't exist upon hurting others. When more and more people realize what true happiness is about, the true standard of living will improve.

I agree that our economic system is geared towards using numbers to define how well off we are. However, there is no true way to measure our utility with numbers. Instead, we should be trying to revamp our way of living to maximize happiness and reduce our carbon footprint. I think those in power see our high numbers of GDP and low unemployment rate and think that the economy is booming. They are against transitioning to be more sustainable in fear that this change will jeopardize our good numbers. However, these numbers, as you said, do not define us, and our true happiness and economic growth could be changed for the better with a plentitude economy. By focusing on intrinsic and social values over materialistic values we could have both a functioning economy and happy people.

The film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” was very interesting to watch.  At the beginning of the film, my materialistic self was overwhelmed by the idea of obtaining this lifestyle.  As I really began to listen to their views over the issue, it made complete sense to me as to why people adopt the lifestyle of a minimalist.  I was impacted greatly by this film because I came to understand that materialistic objects will never satisfy your happiness.  Obtaining materialistic stuff only makes the person want for more.  It is a sad truth in our society how everything portrayed over social media regarding success and happiness seems to be how much a person's net worth is.  This film was inspiring to try and incorporate aspects of this lifestyle into my day to day life.  I see how our planet suffers because of the way we as humans are wasteful.  In incorporating this lifestyle, we can learn to be more happy with what we have and be less wasteful.

I  am with you on the fact that buying materialistic items only makes you want more. There is no other feeling than getting a package you've been waiting for the minute you ordered it. My first thought while watching the part in the documentary "Minimalist" where the woman only wore 33 items in a year was there was no way I could do that. My opinion on this subject changed drastically as I continued watching and I felt a kind of selfish. I was unaware how many lives minimalism changed as I had just put it off as the trend that included tiny houses. It also seemed interesting to me that I had never once stopped and thought about how useless some of these items are yet they play a such huge part in the damage. Consumerism shames viewers into a lifestyle that most can't even afford and it happens so often that people, including myself, have become numb to it. 
<br><br>
While the documentary may have shown some extreme examples of minimalism, I believe everyone can take part in it. Like Ken said this way of living has definitely become a trend as we see many people thrifting and growing their own food while encouraging others to do so. Additionally, documentaries like ''Minimalist" are bring the subject to light in showing how this lifestyle change can also affect your mental and physical health. My only doubts of real change come from economy. Much like the fossil fuel industries, these big consumer companies only care about what puts money in their pocket. Stepping back and learning about the fast fashion and kid aimed commercials I felt brainwashed because I used to never think twice it when they appear. Honestly, don't see any real positive development coming from economy anytime soon which means it comes down to who's willing to change their personal lives for the sake of the planet. I certainly will change my ways for the planet but also for myself which seems a little selfish too.
<br><br><hr><br>

I feel the same as you do. This film tells me how beautiful minimalism can be and I hope that more people could be able to watch this film. To be honest, before watching this film, I doubted the possibility of a person living in a modern society to completely accept the lifestyle of minimalism. However, after watching this film, I wish I could be one of the people that are living a minimalism lifestyle. What impressed me the most are Tammy Strobel’s and Jay Austin’s small homes. They give me a sense of security when looking at these tiny but fully functional rooms. According to David Friedlander a large area of a big house can be hardly used, like dining room, porch, and part of the living room. The construction, cleaning, and electricity consumed of these parts of the house costs a lot more unnecessary carbon emission. Moreover, these extra parts will not provide more happiness for people living in it. It would only cause higher spending on household and more time on cleaning. A 600 square feet home should be enough for a couple if the rooms are arranged optimally and the people living in such a home would feel closer to each other. 
<br><Br>
I also agree with your point that obtaining materialistic stuff only makes people want more. Like what Ryan Nicodemus said in the beginning of the film, he hoped to reach happiness trough buying things and always believed that happiness is right around the corner, but he ended up found out that he was just living for paychecks. As Ken mentioned, encouraging people to live a minimalism lifestyle is not just for the benefit of the environment, but also for the happiness of individuals. It might be a good way of helping people to accept minimalism. If we could adjust ourselves a little bit to minimalism, a large amount of carbon emission would be reduced, and hopefully the environment would be better.

One of the most interesting and frustrating parts of “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” was the part about advertisements that target children. Recently, I have been thinking about how I grew up always feeling self-conscious about the things I own and the brands I wear, constantly bugging my mom to buy me more things, or even more expensive things. This documentary made me realize that the root of this mindset actually dates back further in my life than I thought. Basically since I was old enough to talk, companies have been shoving advertisements for toys, junk food, clothes, and electronics down my throat. No wonder I always felt like I “needed” the newest thing on the shelves at Target. Although the unsustainable consumerism of the 21st century is definitely prominent in adults who spend their salaries on large houses and cars, an important and often overlooked element of this issue is seen in children. And I have already seen it get worse just in my own lifetime. As a babysitter, I always notice the huge amount of belongings that kids today have in their bedrooms. The thing that always seems ironic to me is the giant, bulky cases that kids have on their Apple devices. If you aren’t old enough to be trusted with a fragile device, why are you old enough to have one? Being socialized into this mindset my entire life has definitely affected my habits today, and as I try to move away from the belief that more things will make me happier, I realize the things I am actually “missing” are not tangible at all. I hope, for the environment’s sake, that minimalism grows as a movement, even if not everyone becomes completely minimalist, maybe we can normalize having one car per family, or only buying new clothes twice a year.

I agree with this statement. I, too, came to a sudden realization that throughout my childhood, I was subconsciously giving into the schemes of advertising. In the documentary, the narrator noted that advertising that targeted children have increased significantly. I agree with this, but I also would like to note that not only is it the amount of advertising that increased, it is also the strategies that they have used to promote certain products. You see many kids with iPads and iPhones at earlier ages nowadays because these products are subtly placed in the back of toy and general commercials, whether it be as an extra prop, or the main focus of a "family" depiction. I relate to your perspective of being a babysitter and noticing these things. Most of the kids that I have babysat also had some sort of tablet that they use even if their parents insist that they only have it for "15 minutes a day". The documentary's overall message was very inspiring. I have always been curious about having a capsule wardrobe but was never educated/motivated to do so. But this documentary has opened my eyes to a new way of living. As college students, our dorms/apartments don't have that much space to begin with, so adopting minimalism could be a huge benefit. Even if I don't fully commit to a minimalist style that is exactly like the two guys in the documentary, any step that is towards the minimalist side will be a help to environment and my own personal happiness. I hope that people have this mentality too because being hardcore minimalist can be daunting, but with baby steps, it can be achieved.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I feel you on that level so hard. Growing up, my family didn't have much and so I never wore brands and clothes that other kids wore. I always asked my parents for more, for better and newer things when there wasn't anything wrong with the things they bought me in the first place. I too, realized during this film that we have been advertised to want the newest things since we were kids. Watching television, I was so invested in advertisements with toys and dolls and clothes, I wanted it all. I think that's why now as an adult, I use retail therapy as a stress reliever. It's a bad habit but it's what brings me joy I guess. Knowing that I have these new, materialistic things. Always wanting the newest iPhone, or trendiest clothes is a toxic lifestyle. We are just so embedded into this consumer culture that it became something that was normal. Throwing things away when it was completely still functional. After watching this film, I sat down and looked at my closet and just decluttered it. I felt so ashamed during this closet to clean out as I now realized all the clothes and amount of stuff I had that I barely even used or wore. I guess it's safe to say that those advertisements as a kid followed me into my adult life. I really like this film because it brought a new perspective to my life and actually made me want to take action and stop buying things because it did more harm than good. I'm buying into this capitalist society and spending my money on things I don't need. 

<br><Br>
As to answering Ken's question, I don't really think maximizing minimalism will help the environmental crisis we have right now simply because it isn't doable in our society today. I was always so intrigued by tiny houses and furniture that can be utilized in 5000 different ways. But I don't think that many people would actually convert to that lifestyle because people are always wanting more. Yes, it's doable, but for many people, I don't think it's practical for them.

I do agree with the minimalists’ idea that most people possess things that they don’t actually need. The first time I learn about minimalism was when my high school Buddhism teacher talked about Dan Harris’ 10% Happier, which I found very interesting. Later, when I started to clean out my dorm room before graduation, I came to realize how much I own that I don’t actually need. I would have packed boxes stored in my wardrobe for an entire year and yet I didn’t even bother to open them until right before graduation. Thus, when I was packing for college, I tried to pack less, because “by having less, you are stressing what you do have.”

Minimalism can be understood as living a simple life. It is easy to talk about this topic, however, how many of us can stand out and say proudly, “I’ve spent my whole life pursuing knowledge, relationship with families, friends and I never buy an unnecessary thing.” I can’t. I just purchased a couple of shoes last week although I have three. It’s really ironic to write my comment here.
<br><Br>
One of my courses also asks me to learn about the American Dream and how modern companies advertise us. They enlarge or redefine the American Dream to attract customers. Have you ever thought about why your phone is good enough, but just can’t help yourself when Apple introduces a new one? Nowadays, advertisements tell us that new is the best. Our desire become larger and larger and end up buying so many things that we actually don’t need. As the author of Walden said, what we pursue is not the essence of life, but the endless desires.
<br><br>
I like the last sentence of the movie, “Love people, use things.” However, we live in the opposite, which is “Love things, use people.” People can betray their friends for money, or even kill others. Don’t let the money-oriented society cover up the meaning of life, which is enjoying every day, not working like a machine and buy unnecessary things.

the last sentence of the documentary "Minimalism," also stood out to me. It's such a simple notion that seemingly gets lost over and over again within our society, as people become consumed with the monetary value of items and the status attached to those items. We begin using people and hurting those around us in order to obtain things, when we should be using things in order to make real connections with the people around us. The documentary was very useful in depicting this by the first hand accounts it presented of people feeling unhappy even after achieving the six figure paying jobs that they had always dreamed of having. Money is NOT everything. I know that sounds cliche in a society that is literally driven by a dollar sign, but money is not everything in the sense of people basing their opinions on the possessions that they/others have. Living a life of minimalism does not have to be as drastic as some people make it out to be. I interpreted it as living a life that is not saturated by all the newest devices or clothing that comes out. I am also guilty of being that person who wants the newest iphone or laptop, but I have realized that there are ways that I can feed healthy habits of consumerism, such as thrifting/recycling clothes instead of buying new clothes at the mall. I mean, every contribution does help right?

Watching this video was surprisingly interactive, as I found myself often scanning around my room looking at all of the belongings inside the four walls. Every foot of every wall was scattered with furniture, clothes, and goods. A quote that stuck out to me was stated by Joshua. He said, “Every item I own serves a purpose— there is no excess stuff. I have to  justify to myself, does this add value to my life, and if not, I have to let go.” As I heard that and reflected on my own bedroom scenario, I was disappointed. I looked at all of my belongings, many of them untouched in boxes under my desk. Watching this has inspired me to do a deep clean of my belongings and hopefully shed many of them. I know this may not be a definitional shift to becoming a minimalist, but I think being aware and conscious of such a lifestyle still offers a therapeutic shedding both physically and metaphorically.
<br><br>

I was also blown away by the stats about the storage unit industry! I was baffled that annually people spend over $2 billion on extra space for their extra things. The ideals of the American Dream have pressured humans to live for the ‘extra’. People are living in the past and wanting a better future, but I think it would serve everyone to live in the present.

I had the same experience while watching this documentary! As I watched Joshua give a tour of his house and closet and explain how every belonging he had was something valuable to him, I found myself looking at my own closet and picking out the clothes and accessories that I never really used or had worn once in my life. It’s very easy to accumulate an excess of material goods with the mindset of “I’m sure I’ll use it at some point for some occasion”. What resonated with me was when one of the women in the film was explaining how we keep these materials to be prepared for any situation but when we let go of them we realize that there are other solutions (such as borrowing clothes for friends or renting out materials) that are much more feasible (rather than having one dress for every occasion for example). What I also appreciated was when Ryan was explaining that if you have a collection that you love, there is no need to get rid of it. Rather, minimalism is more about keeping things that hold a genuine vale and importance in your life. 

<br><Br>
While I cannot say that I will be making a complete shift to minimalism anytime soon, this film did encourage me to really take a look at what materials I hold valuable and what materials I can live without and has pushed me to start taking steps to get rid of my excess possessions.
<br><Br>
I also felt the same way when he said that everything that he has around him he has to justify to himself why he has it and if it brings value or happiness into his life. I stopped the video and looked around to my side of the room and realized that a lot of the things I had I didn't use, wear, or even need. One thing they touched on in the video is how Americans have so many clothing items because of all the ‘different seasons’ and that was something I felt that made me keep more things that I do not need at the moment. I have a box in my closet full of tank tops and shorts that I do not use now but I tell myself ‘oh it's for the summer, I will need that”. I think that is also the mindset of a lot of people here in California, for example, they may have multiple sweaters to fit the weather on a week, maybe it will be sunny or rainy. I will also look over everything I have and see what I do not need anymore. I do not see myself getting rid of everything and just owning a couple of things, but I will try to not buy any more unnecessary things.

I didn’t think I had that much stuff until I saw Colin Wright, the full-time traveler featured in the film, carrying all his possessions in two duffel bags. The prospect of carrying all that I own on my person is not only daunting, but impossible. This led me to question why I had so many things, how they were made and how I acquired them, and most importantly, if they were adding value to my life. Through this thought process, I realized I could effectively rid myself of about a third of the things around me without feeling a loss; most of these things were articles of clothing and trinkets. We already know that by simply reassessing our possessions and reducing purchases, we can have an impact on our personal ecological footprint; so why don’t we?
<br><br>
I believe we are entirely addicted to our stuff. The first step to breaking an addiction is recognizing there is one in the first place, which is where many may struggle; it is easier to justify current behavior than to realize its flaws and change. As the film and Ken mention, some think that a minimalist lifestyle will leave them deprived; I think this is subject to interpretation. A minimalist lifestyle does not have a strict set of rules, nobody is telling anyone to get rid of everything, nor does it have to be a rapid transition. I think that one of the benefits of reducing what we own is having a greater appreciation for what we keep.
<br><Br>
As for ecological impact, simply by reducing what we purchase and refusing to play into the materialistic and consumerist industries, as much as they will try to prevent such a shift, we will improve the status of the planet. A lot of the emissions and waste that are Earth carcinogens occur during the production of material goods, and we perpetuate these processes by buying excessively. However there are ways to, as the minimalists state, “free yourself” from the consumerist/ materialist addiction; one of my new year’s resolutions is to not purchase a new material good.

I completely agree that we are extremely addicted to material goods. Growing up, I learned that the more you have, the more successful you are. In my family success is determined by large abundances of two things: money and stuff. I’m sure my family is not the only one that also has this same viewpoint. Yet growing up with so much stuff, I realized, like Nicodemus and Millburn, that I did not feel full by the stuff surrounding me. Since then, I have rejected the notion that I need to have a lot of stuff to be successful and no longer find value in things. Though I am not perfect, most of the time I make an honest analysis if I need something, and if I do not, then I do not buy it. 
<br><Br> 
I partly disagree that breaking an addiction is to first recognize it. Many people recognize their addiction to stuff, but have failed to mitigate it because they are not honest with their feelings toward their stuff. I’ve heard statements like “I know I’m addicted to things, but they make me feel happy.” I am a victim of it myself. So, they know they have an addiction, but do they know if they are truly happy. I cannot speak for them, but from my experience, I realized that stuff did not make me feel happier, which was the reason I began to stop consuming so much stuff. 
 <br><br>
As you stated, minimalism is an important response to the climate crisis. Overconsumption depletes the earth’s already limited resources. Moreover, production of material goods increases the emission of greenhouse gases. By minimizing our material goods, companies would produce less, thereby decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. Minimalism is not a perfect answer. Though it is part of the solution in slowing down the climate crisis, it is not the solution. For minimalism to be impactful, the majority of people would need to adopt the lifestyle, which calls for them to reevaluate their relationship to stuff. That process may take time, but the earth does not have a lot of time, so other solutions should be implemented.

The documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” introduced another way of living. A lifestyle using the least but the most efficient and useful things to fulfill and maintain our daily life. This documentary makes me rethink of my own lifestyle so seriously and I really find that perhaps it is urgent for us to develop this kind of lifestyle, which is not affected by any other people or any advertisements, getting rid of the effects of the celebrities or the huge posters for the things on sale. We need to live with our own thoughts and remain true to ourselves, which means we need to figure out what’s the things we really need and will not use them only once. 
<br><Br>
For me, I commit that I am now at a age of getting fulfillment from buying stuffs, living the life of buying one or two new clothes or cosmetics every week, which aims to make me feel happy or a kind of relax after a tough week of studying and working. It is a strange feeling, since buying stuffs is like a kind of completing a goal every week, maybe that is the true meaning of empty stage in my life. 
<br><br>
To make matters worse, this is a time filled with advertisements, cosmetics, shoes and clothes, when people see beautiful things, they want to have it, this is human nature. Everybody want to own beautiful things. We may also want to live the glamorous or relaxing lives, like many Youtubers or Instagrammers do, so we buy things following their steps, or imitating them, since we wish to live better, or maybe to live a life similar with theirs. As I said in the first paragraph, this is the trend of people’s lives nowadays and these need to be changed to the way of living for ourselves.

This is undoubtedly an excellent documentary, I can’t agree more with the points and it needs some time for me to change my living style to only listen to my own voices when fulling my desires.

The idea of minimalism is a new idea to me and I find it really amazing. I truly believe it would be a great idea to be implemented into our life now and if we all can follow its principle and make some little changes to our current life styles, I believe the climate and environmental issue can be changed a lot.
<br><Br>

To have a complete change in our lives: to live in the simplest way might actually be hard sometimes since most of us have not been living our lives in this way especially this generation. But minimalism is a great idea to let us rethink about the lives we have been living for so long. It is time that we not only live lives for ourselves but for the planet.

<br><Br>
I totally understand how we all have the desire to go shopping, buy stuff we want, which is completely normal.But it is where the issue comes in, since many of our actions are actually affected by the ads we have on nowadays and the ideology of being rich, live life in a luxurious way and things like that.This is why we need this new idea to remind ourselves changing our way of consumption. And it is time to really pay attention to the impacts we put on our planet due to the style we all have been living.

While I feel that it is important to reevaluate your own choices based upon the presentation of the minimalistic approach, I feel that it's also a difficult one to undergo. You've pointed out that purchasing new goods is rewarding, and I feel the same way, but for a whole society to undergo this change, it'd take a large cultural and emotional shift. The idea that tangible goods are something that are not a reflection of the individual would be an emotional undertaking by many. As Ken has pointed out in other lectures, he represented his generation through the idea of 'I worked for these things,' which is a viable argument, through the mindset instilled by the generations surrounding theres. In my eyes, this would require, just as climate change a whole campaign and change in consumerism in order to address the error in our ways. In more ways than one, this would require all of us to create piles of 'trash, keep, and donate' piles based on utility and practicality. While I throughly enjoyed this documentary, I feel that in a sense it was lacking in call to action. Presenting the argument through snippets of the presentations the two made, interest in the film I believe relied heavily upon a prior interest in the idea, rather than newly convincing anyone. Regardless it is a practice in which I have tried to enact in my life with the donation and cleaning of old things.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I agree everyone is influenced with today's social media and advertisements. People are constantly trying to meet the expectations they see portrayed by various companies that are seeking profits.Most of the image portrayed is success which is demonstrated with ownership of certain items considered valuable or trending. That is why people I think tend to buy without actually really needing half of the things they get, which then makes more waste that hurts the environment. I think people need to conscious on what they buy and society should try to change their mindset to be satisfied with less, which benefits the planet.

Personally, I am also going to strive to declutter my life. Often times I feel overwhelmed by the amount of invaluable things I have laying around. I have already taken upon myself to donate clothes and buy second hand but I also know that it will take years for me to bring down the amount of items I have. However, this brings up a problem I saw. Some parts of Minimalism I felt where extremely privileged… well at least the parts where people were just throwing away stuff they bought. Not only is that just thrown into the dumps, people are also struggling out there to even get the basic necessities. 
<br><br>

With that being said, I do feel like living an intentional life is a goal everyone could have. I think with a mix everyone striving for minimalism and reducing waste, shopping second hand, etc. it will definitely make a dent in your personal carbon footprint. However, I do not think it is enough to get us out of the climate crisis. To take that extra step, something needs to happen politically and that needs to happen fast.

It is a necessity of mine as well to declutter my living space. I have a lot of stuff. I don't use it all, yet find myself needlessly attached to these things and unable to rid myself of them. However, whenever I feel badly about the amount of seemingly pointless stuff I have in my possession, I consider how much more I could have if I kept all that I had. There's this ongoing issue with my mother and I that she gives me things that I just don't need. I've never liked shopping, and don't often bring new items into my collection of stuff because I am aware that I pretty much already have enough. But my mother loves shopping, especially for me, and will gladly buy me random jackets, pants, and shoes... some of which I already have! It's frustrating to watch her spend money unnecessarily, especially when finances have always been a rough spot between us. I've spoken with my family about this issue, since I really feel it is a destructive pattern to needlessly spend money and not receive gratitude in return, and I was offered some very relevant suggestions. My cousin says it is a generational thing: his mom does the same for him. Our parents grew up with their parents leaving a time of war, when excess was scarce and little was shared between large families. This is a strong contributing factor to the amount of stuff one has being equated with success: it means they have overcome the need for frugality. But now, in our modern world, it is clear that there is not only no need for so much, but that it is a harmful mindset to have as well.
<br><Br>
Unfortunately, companies are aware of this mindset and take advantage of it. When the documentary revealed the strategy clothing companies use to ensure business of destroying unsold clothing to allow space for new marketing and prevent resale, my heart dropped. While I'm hopeful that is not a common occurrence, it is a terrible thing to imagine products being manufactured for the sake of destruction in order to promote consumerism. I've always hated trends, and its terrible what they are doing to the pocket of consumers and the amount of our resources. The other insufferable happening mentioned by the documentary is that of marketing to children. What a nasty game to play to sell entirely wasteful and pointless products to those who won't even know the difference if they own it or not. The toy section at Target makes me SO angry. At my work with young children I have witnessed first hand the way that media and marketing affects the obsessions of the developing mind, and it is easy to see how this indoctrination of consumerist ideals is implemented to create a culture of shoppers and society filled with wasteful desires. I genuinely believe if this were to be overturned, if society as a whole worked to minimize consumerism, technology, and unnecessary possessions, that a lot of problems would be solved. If supply and demand is the name of the game, there's no way to keep playing without the "demand" aspect.

A big contributor to climate change is mass consumerism due to the excess amount of planet resources being exploited and the use of fossil fuels to produce. The simple answer to this issue is minimalism. Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields make this lifestyle seem beneficial all around. By detailing their lives of relative wealth as miserable until they let go of materialistic values, they effectively persuade the viewers into seriously considering minimalism. This is further explained by the YouTube video as it states that materialistic values and pro-social values are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. This took me by surprise because although I did not think of the two values as going hand in hand, I did not expect them to be in such polar ends such that as one value rises, the other value falls. The correlation between the two is particularly disheartening since we live in a society in which materialism is excessively promoted through a juggernaut of advertisements. Whereas minimalism is an appealing lifestyle to me, it is simply appalling to many others because of the values our society holds onto materialism. To make the transition into minimalism easier, our society needs to change its way of functioning into a plentitude economy and into promoting intrinsic values instead.

I personally enjoyed the film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things." I've read a book written by a Japanese writer who advocates to throw away unnecessary stuff in the bedroom but back to that time I don't know the term "minimalism". One line in the film hunted me "You're like a puppet with strings that should be pulled by Mother Nature and evolution. " We shouldn't be the puppet that is controlled by overconsumption. Today's advertisement industry is poisoning people through movies, TV shows, books and radio broadcats that they are making people always want to buy more without questioning the value of consumption. What can we do more with less? All the examples in the film tells us that it's time to sit down, take a deep breath and think about what actually brings us happiness in life. Living in a chaotic, fast-pasted world, buying things without thinking can't fulfill the emptiness deep rooted in our heart. They will only create more holes in our body and gradually, what we thought could bring us happiness will end up killing us.
<br><br>
The 33 challenge in the film surprises me. The project itself was so interesting. Simply wearing 33 items in 3 months seems unbelievable today. I always find myself buying clothes, shoes and cosmetics without asking myself "Do I have enough now?" It's crazy that people think they need more and better. Do a pair of new sneakers add value to my life? Do I really need it? Is the feeling of being fashionable among peers makes me feel happy? Is that feeling wrong or unhealthy? I started question myself when watching this film and ended up with the conclusion that, I did buy many things meaningless, and the happiness they brought me didn't last long.
<br><Br>
Trying to bring more values in life is the source of happiness. The moment when you feel yourself no longer being controlled by advertisements, commercials, fashion trends, the madness of buying things crazily...That's the point you are actually gonna live your life. Making wise choices and being the leader of your life is important.

Trying to a minimalist in life and do more with less things, it will not only relief the pressure on nature, but also set our heart free.

This is by far my favorite documentary in this course. This minimalism lifestyle is not only environmentally friendly, but also cool. The way these people design their houses…that’s just breathtaking & breathless for me. I personally have a little bit of interest in designing stuff. I want to design my house that way as well. I think when people get rid of most of their useless stuff from their house or from their heart, they can allow more happiness and relaxation and friends in. In that way, their lives will be much happier.
<br><br>
I agree with the theory of ‘minimalism’ and I support these people. However, I wish I can buy a lot of stuff. I want to buy an old typewriter. I want to buy a Bluetooth speaker. I want to buy some sort of machine that can let myself train how to play table tennis so that I don’t have to find a person to train me. …(sorry I leak my wish) These are all expensive stuff, but I just like them. I want to collect things. I think these things will make me happy as well, same kind of happiness these minimalists feel.

“Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” is a really interesting documentary that makes an argument for a lifestyle that can greatly benefit people spiritually, economically, and socially. The current hyper materialistic lifestyle that the majority of Americans follow is highly unsustainable and harmful to the environment. I have seen this perversion of the American Dream within my own family. My parents have this peer pressure stemming from their friends to get a larger house. Anytime we go to a get together between families the first topic after leaving is often about the new house and how much nicer it is than the older house that the family lived in. I have actively been trying to convince my parents that we have no need for a bigger house and that our current one is more than sufficient. I have also made a decision within my life to not purchase any new clothes unless out of absolute necessity. I believe that valuing people and relationships instead of material goods will greatly improve the American lifestyle.

In your comment, you say that you first thought minimalism was more of a trendy decision than a lifestyle change with a very liberal motive. This is not uncommon. However, maybe some people who are transitioning into the minimalistic lifestyle are, in fact, doing it for this reason. It’s a cool, new trend that makes you seem quirky and down to earth if you take it up—especially when you blog about it on social media, or even write a book about it. Your response reminded me of the part in the film where the woman with the tiny house tools the audience is how she came upon tiny houses. It caught my attention how she said something like, “the minute I saw tiny houses, I was hooked!” It sounded like she was hopping on some bandwagon or fad that she thought was cool...By all means people should take up minimalism no matter what their intentions are, whether they like it for its trendiness or for its positive environmental impact, right?? The problem with trends is that they come and go, while choosing minimalism will only be impactful if it’s maintained in the long run.

Going off of what you have stated and what I have learned back in English 22 with Hiltner, you aren't wrong about America's greater addiction to materials and it's greater issue for the planet overall. What is interesting about every single life on this planet is that we all carry a footprint, a "Carbon Footprint", which is essentially an overall accumulation  of carbon we have emitted now and in the past. Now you may be saying this to yourself and many others too, but "I must have a very small carbon footprint as I don't drive, etc", however, it is a lot larger than we all think. From the clothes you wear to the phone you hold in your hand, to the bike we ride and the food we eat, it has a major carbon background that ever expands our greater carbon footprint beyond what do so believe. Every single material we own has a carbon footprint of it's own an is something we tend to forget because of the fact that we become ungrateful for what materials we have around our own lives and Americans, as myself before taking any of Hiltner's courses, become blinded by our own addictions. We don't see the greater consequences that lie behind every single possession and material we own because tend to look towards the value rather than the material itself. Watching the film, "True Cost", it opened my mind to what consequences emerge behind what goes into every piece of clothing we own and watching people suffer so we can feel better about ourselves for the meantime before looking else where. 
<br><Br><hr><br>
The minimalist lifestyle has it's benefits both for the planet and and ourselves. For instance, the minimalist lifestyle will allow us to reduce the amount of materials we surround ourselves with which will most certainly reduce our carbon footprint that we leave on this planet. The problem with our materialistic societies around the world is that we buy, buy, buy, with ads forced into our faces telling us that buying these materials will make us happier and live a much more enjoyable life which undoubtedly trick many into believing and then falling back down they're deep hole. This causes us to keep buying unnecessary materials which ever so add up to the carbon in the atmosphere. This is where the minimalist life style fights back and pulls us out of the hole because of the fact that we will be happy with what we have and grateful just for that. Seeing a minimalist lifestyle will be crucial for people looking for ways to better impact the fight against climate change because it's an accessible lifestyle that we all can start now and I believe will be achievable once people see the better side it brings to the table for themselves and the planet overall.

Just the title already attracted my attention. Materialism is one of the most toxic traits in this society and everyone who idolizes material needs to watch this film. I liked how Minimalism showed a diverse group of people showing their minimalistic lifestyle. Although I feel that everyone should watch this film, I think most likely the people who would watch this are people who are interested in living  a minimalistic lifestyle. I think for most people who watch this will leave being less materialistic but will not fully become minimalistic. This film had a good balance of funny and serious moments. I loved how this film showed how much happier and healthier your life can be if you choose to not be materialistic. As someone who already does not shop as much, I did not really learn much from the film but feel hopeful that others are moving in that direction. I would recommend this film to all my shopaholic friends. I wish that people could see that there really isn't much joy in buying new things. I know that I am guilty of wanting the new and latest things as well. However, these days I am trying to shift more to thrifting or just maintaining the objects that I correctly own well.

Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things successfully conveys its subject. It mainly introduces a lifestyle that have positive influence to the climate. Ryan and Joshua took about 10 months to travel around the US to share their stories and propagate their minimalist lifestyle. Living tiny houses is one of typical minimalist lifestyle. However, today people dream to live in a big house. One thing that surprised me that this film mentions that money cannot all the happiness. Money no longer can make you happy. Although you earn so much money and buy larger house, these cannot make you happy as well. This film also talks about fast fashion which is opposite from the minimalism. Many people purchase fast fashion in order to get into the hot trend. People always buy different popular clothes. Actually, these clothes are unnecessary. However, these clothes are not poplar in the next season any more. It has been a huge waste of materials. Also, it is the same problem on buying toys. Children always want to have different types of similar toys. It also a big waste. Not only especially for the clothes and toys, it is common for people to buy unnecessary stuff in order to pursue trend. I think this film resonates with me. I always see my full closet and said no clothes can wear. After watching this film, I know the advantages of minimalism. Maybe I cannot insist to be a minimalism, but I can try my best to make my life more minimalistic

I do not intend to have a life of minimalism. However, my current life, which I feel much better than before,  is similar to minimalism. As the movie said, the desire of staff came from our genes. The people who want more and gather more have a better chance to survive and to have offspring. This lifestyle does not fit the current society anymore. Most people be protected by the law and no worry about surviving. Thus, the goal of humans become to find happiness and success. Both of those goals are long-term which need people to sacrifice other things and fight against human nature. 
<br><br>
I use most of the things in my room every day. If I am not sure whether I will use a thing or not, I will throw it away. Because most time, it is just the desire of the occupy. Same situation in shopping, a lot of things we may not need at all. However, after we buy them, we need to spend energy and time on it. Minimalism also means to reduce the wants or goals. Just to have one or two main goals to work on. The minus can make us more concentrated and peaceful. We will have an incredible life quality than before.

I was really engaged in the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things.” I actually didn’t find it boring one bit, it really got me thinking. I totally agreed with what they were trying to do and even though you don’t need to be exactly like them and live that lifestyle it’s still good to think about the stuff you have. Back at my parents house I know there is a ton of things we buy that we don’t really need. They are just luxuries. There were a few quotes that I took to heart from the film. One was “What I love about my life now is I can be genuine, there is no more manipulation.” This is referring to the fact that he used to be in this profession where that’s what he did , he sold consumers products. I feel like that quotes very important as well as a quote that was said at the very end. “Love people and use things because the opposite never works.” This is a deep quote that can mean many different things to people. To me I interpret it as the fact that humans are very materialistic. But as stated in the film we are the wrong type of materialistic. This film gave me so inspiration to change if i’m being honest. I really thought happiness was you being rich and owning a lot of things. After watching this film I don’t think that anymore. You actually can be happier with limited things and only the necessities. Im really glad I watched this film.

I also really enjoyed this film. I thought the message was very interesting. I had always viewed happiness as being able to afford whatever you wanted. I believed that after college I would get a job and keep working until I was at the top. Now I'm not sure if that's what I want. I don't want to constantly be trying to fill a void with stuff that has absolutely no value or meaning to me. While I personally don't think I could live the exact way as some of the people in this movie, I think I could adopt some of their views and ideas. I really liked the 33 item challenge and I want to try it at some point this year.  
<br><Br>
I can see how working to achieve the goal of wealth can make a person unhappy. My dad works extremely hard so my family can have the best possible life. He does this so we can go to college, go on trips, and afford other luxuries. The downside is because he works so hard and so many hours, I don't get to see as often as I would like. He is also very tired all the time and stressed a lot. I think that originally he liked his job, but I'm not so sure anymore. 
<br><br>
I think that since America is a very influential country if we became minimalist the rest of the world would follow. Unfortunately, I believe that it would take quite some time for Americans to give up their luxurious lifestyles.

The documentary “Minimalist” addresses the issue that bothers me for a long time. I felt trapped by consumption. I love the feeling of purchase the things I want and I like, and also I love to purchase what others have and what I think I may want to own. But the utility of having all these things does not increase as I own all of the items that I think I may want to buy. In the documentary, people tell me that money can’t buy happiness, and a tremendous amount of money doesn’t make people become happier. A famous quote here is “I wish everyone becomes rich and famous, so they will find out that’s not an answer.” Minimalist lifestyle focuses on building our own lifestyles, giving up all the useless things, leaving all the things behinds besides our favorite things. A lot of people choose to to move to a tiny place as their place to live. They tried on Project 333, which they will only have 33 items to dress up in 3 months. And surprisingly nobody notice that they only have 33 items to dress up in this 3 months. They get relaxed and feel incredibly happy as soon as they sacrifice other things and turned into minimalist lifestyle. We don’t need that much things as we think of. We can only own the things we really want by giving up the things that we don’t really need in our lives to release ourselves from heavy burden. The documentary is really impactful and inspirational. I want to try the new style of life now.

I agree with what you said about buying a bunch of stuff and feeling trapped by consumption. I’m definitely guilty of buying things simply because I can and not because I actually need the item. Even looking around my room, I begin to notice that I have a bunch of stuff that I have no use for. They serve no purpose and I cannot remember why I bought the item in the first place. The same goes for clothing and shoes. There are things that are in my wardrobe that I have never worn or only used a handful of times. I was also surprised to learn that nobody noticed that people who participated in Project 333 were wearing the same 33 items for 3 months. Nowadays, people are concerned with keeping up with latest trends or buying the newest products that they don’t stop to think -- do I actually need this? It’s sad to see how our society has become trapped in this vicious cycle of consumerism and materialism that they fail to notice that there is more to life than just possessions.
<br><Br>
After watching this film, I too want to try working towards a minimalist lifestyle. I would like to reduce my consumption and decrease the amount of things that I buy. The film really put it into perspective that living a minimalist life isn’t that hard. Anyone can do it if they tried and put the effort into it. The film also really does a good job at showing that just because you live a minimalist life, it doesn’t mean that you have to give up everything and lead a boring life.

When they start the documentary, they talk a lot about the hunt. The hunt to be happy by buying more and more and more. The craving and hunger to continue to feed your life with more clothes, and more tech, and more anything in order to fill the void that is causing your unhappiness. But, when does the hunt stop? And the answer is never. We will never be satisfied with what we have if we always look to buy or gain what is not ours. 
<br><Br>
How does that change? How can we, as a society, alter those perceptions. I believe that the documentary does a really great job of answering that question by understanding what are the needs and what are the wants. When Joshua goes on the road for 10 months to promote his book, the audience can see what he brought: one pair of jeans, two jackets, a couple of shirts and boxers, his toiletries, and a blowdryer. This is all he brought for 10 months of traveling. In the documentary, we never see him wishing he had more or looking to buy something else because he has exited the consumerism game; he has left the hunt. Instead, he knows what he needs, and feels fulfilled, not by the items that he owns, but by the people that he knows. The last line of the documentary, “Love people and use things because the opposite never works,” really struck with me. So much of the time we get caught up in believing that if we get this much money or that we can buy this car or watch or have this thing, we will achieve our happiness because those are our perceived greatest desires. However, when we realize that the holes in our heart cannot be filled with the number of zeros on a paycheck or the amount of shoes in our closets, we must try and discover a way to gain happiness without those things. 
<br><br>

Life is full of meaning. And those things don’t always give meaning. However, what I think I really enjoyed about the documentary is that they talked about people. And people give life meaning, not things. And if you could have seen this documentary in some sort of way, I hope that people - just like myself - can take away with that message.

I have heard about minimalism and people being minimalistic before watching this documentary Minimalism, but after watching the film I was shocked to see how much I still didn’t know about the lifestyle. It is not just about having very little stuff just because they want to live that lifestyle but because they have realized that there are more important things than having the latest clothing or the newest technology that comes out. At one point in the documentary, one of the males that were speaking said that all of his things were important and a necessity for him. He had the bare essentials to live a comfortable life and had realized how much happier he was not having to keep up with the Jones’. 
<br><Br>
I think it’s crazy how many people think they can buy their happiness. As the documentary said, people are buying the newest things that come out to fill a void in them. It is not happiness they are buying because once something new and improved comes out they lose interest and start finding things wrong with what they already have in order to have a reason to buy something new.
<br><Br>
The movie discussed how many people are materialistic and fall into the trap of capitalism. When watching this movie it made me think of one of my roommates. She is always looking online to buy new clothes or looking to buy another new purse. Of course, there is nothing wrong with wanting new things, but when it gets to the point when they don’t need these things people are buying it becomes a problem. Not a lot of people want to buy already used clothes - from a thrift store - because of the idea that someone else has worn them. Also, not a lot of people are willing to get rid of stuff they don’t really need or use because of the excuse “But what if I need it later?” or “There might be a time when I might actually need these things.” Becoming a minimalist will not only better benefit their life but it will help the environment out tremendously.

I think that “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” video does a really great job explaining both the problems of the current economic system and the solutions. It highlights that our current economy has left millions unemployed and increases consumption. Then, it introduces the plenitude economy, which shortens work hours and increases employment while being more sustainable. The video acknowledges problems that may arise with this, such as benefits, but conveys that they are fixable. Also, it was smart to include the Netherlands as an example for a country that worked under a system similar to the one the video explains. If the Netherlands can make it work, then other countries should be able to as well.
 <br><Br>
 The “High Price of Materialism” video exemplifies the fact that the people of status who probably play a large role in the climate crisis, due to their high consumption, are the same people who are least likely to practice sustainable habits like riding bikes to work and recycling. This connects to the fact that more developed countries are ruining the environment for the less developed countries, who are not doing much to contribute to the climate crisis and who are less equipped to deal with the consequences. I also think it is really important how the video said that we need to remove materialistic ads from the media because it is influencing children’s minds. When I was younger, I remember seeing ads on TV and constantly pointing to it and telling my parents “I want that!”, and I did not realize until much later how unhealthy it is to see these ads and instantly think you need whatever item they are trying to sell.

I agree with your comment. I do feel that the things that lead us to buying so much into this materialist culture is that we continuously see these ads of the newest things and we see videos of celebrities we deeply admire and we buy this stuff because we want to be like them. I liked the video "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" because it depicted a perfect lifestyle and gave ways as to achieve this lifestyle. In the video "High Price of Materialism", we are left looking at the cause of this unsatisfied lifestyle and also given ways we can achieve this idealistic one. Achieving these idealistic lifestyles includes minimizing what we purchase. I also admired how they were able to propose a solution such as cutting workers hours, but increasing the number of workers but still being able to address the main issue of the pay difference. This is a main concern I thought of as soon as that proposition was announced, but the video was able to address my concerns immediately after hearing it. I find it very incomprehensible that a small percentage of the most wealthiest people own more than half the wealth. I do not understand why someone would need that much money. I also agree with your incorporating the activities provided that have little to none economic impact on the environment. I liked how the videos did this because without these reasons, there would be little reason as to why someone would switch to the methods they are suggesting. I also like how they incorporated proof of how this can lead to a happier lifestyle because it would give you more leisure time and you would not be so concerned with the way you look. I feel that I am most happiest when I am not spending money on things I do not need and actually get to spend time with friends like go to the beach or just go for a walk.

I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary “Minimalism: a Documentary About the Important Things.” I have wished I could be a minimalist for a long time, but just can’t seem to be able to do it. For me, I have wanted to be a minimalist for my own mental health -- something that is one of the main focuses of the film. Having so much stuff around me stresses me out, and it feels like no matter how much I clean, there are always more things laying around, and there just simply isn’t room for it all. I never really thought about minimalism as something I would do for the environment, but it makes perfect sense. If I am only allowed to own 33 items of clothes, I definitely won’t be buying things I don’t need. 
<br><Br>
 I am also very glad that the film touched upon being a minimalist with children. When I go back home there is a family that I always babysit for. My mom was the child’s pre-school teacher, and she was close with his mom. When I first went over to their house, I asked my mom if they were moving. She said no and wondered why I asked. I told her I was wondering because the house was completely empty. This family had never referred to themselves as minimalists to me, but I think it’s the only word for how they live. At first, I thought their home felt cold and unlived in, and I thought, “I would never want my home to look like this.” But the more I went over there, the more I was able to notice the things that they did have, and how everything truly did have a purpose. This also made it more homey in a sense, because everything seemed to have value. 
<br><Br>
 Unfortunately, I think that if Americans were to try to move towards minimalism, it would take generations, if it would happen at all. I think that corporations have too much power, and until that power is taken away, nothing like this could ever really become a reality.

Similar to you, I also feel stressed whenever there is too much stuff that is just laying around that has no meaning. After watching this film, it made me think of Marie Kondo which is a Japanese woman who is known for decluttering and living a more organized lifestyle. I have personally watched her videos and learned the Marie Kondo method which is where you take an item, hold it close to your heart and if it doesn’t spark joy in you, you don’t really need it. It’s a great way to know what you really want to keep and if you can donate anything you no longer need or wear to people of need. This helps clear up the environment around you and clears your mind about buying and consuming things you really need. 
<br><br>
I also wanted to talk about the house part of your comment and I think that having less stuff or furniture in your home makes it look better. I came from an Asian household where we have a lot of random items for the future and don’t really have a use for it throughout the year unless for a certain time and I think it’s not a great use of space in the house. When I am able to afford my own place in the future, I do really want to live in a tiny house. I have watched so many videos on Youtube where people show off their tiny homes and it seems really nice. Of course, space is much smaller than what you’re used to but I think tiny homes are a great solution to the overgrowing population that is happening in the world right now. I like the fact that you are able to see throughout the house without any problem and it’s so small that you barely have to walk to get to another place in the apartment. The only thing that would be bad is the storage space but that’s why being a minimalist comes in.

I agree that the film really did a great job portraying a family who practices minimalism because I feel like when most people think of a minimalist they think of a single person. Having children and allowing them to experience the minimalist lifestyle without realizing they are "missing out", is probably an extremely daunting task. Another important reason is that it is de-stigmatizing the assumption that big American families cannot just "not waste". I also agree that if the modern American wanted to approach the minimalist lifestyle...that would also create an abundance of waste, a surplux of people trying to get rid of their extra stuff. The whole process would be messy if it was expedited, but I do think society is moving towards that. Everything is faster, smaller, and compact. Minimalism is something corporations probably despise but the movement hopefully will change that notion
<br><Br><hr><br>
I agree with you. We have already lent our livelihoods to the domination of consumer products, so getting us out of that trench is difficult and almost seems helpless. 
<br><br>
At the same time, I actually think the reason Josh and Ryan's movement towards minimalism was able to become so prominent is because Americans are more conscious of the detrimental consequences of consumerism. So while corporations do have immense power in our society, I think by acknowledging the power of rejecting consumerist behaviors, building a movement around consuming less for happiness doesn't appear to be so hard. Americans can relate to stories like that of Joshua, who regretted not spending more time with his mother because of his obsession with pursuing money and corporate growth. The need for minimalism is so apparent in our society that I think creating that kind of culture is plausible.

In all honesty, the film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” was very inspiring compared to the other films I have seen for this course. The difference with this film is that it takes a different approach in tackling the view of minimalism, not only from an environmental perspective, but also from the perspective of life. It shows that we in fact don’t need materialistic things in our everyday life to feel fulfilled, or even happy. In fact, the film elaborates on the contrary by implying that materialistic things make life more meaningless, or in other words less meaningful. They are not the things that bring meaning to one’s life, but our culture has been wired to believe the opposite. The thing I believe is that people have this image in their head, an image that shows them what it’s really like to be happy, and they believe this image in their head is the key, when in reality, it’s not. A main reason for this is advertising. Advertising, as stated in the film, has polluted our culture and I 100% agree it has. It’s everywhere. These advertisements depict the false reality of what truly makes someone happy. This is why people work so hard for money. This is why people believe money buys happiness. Sure it’s nice to have, but it shouldn’t be look upton as something that has a value in terms of happiness. If this were true, life would be a lot different. This is why you don’t see people happy or excited to go to their miserable, nine-to-five jobs. We are humans, intellectual beings that are too evolved to base our happiness and well-being from the possession of materialistic things. What we truly value are things that are beyond are scope of comprehension. It’s not something you can grasp, it’s much deeper than that. It varies from person to person, meaning what you might think is valuable to you on a deeper level, doesn’t necessarily mean it will carry the same value for someone else. But I can assure that these valuable entities can’t just be bought with money... they are found, acknowledged, and cherished by those who have found it. 
<br><Br>
Ok, sorry, kind of went off track for a moment, but back to the film. The film shows that living the minimalist lifestyle exerts less stress on oneself. This is true, because the less things one has, the less things to think and worry about. This shows that they just need the essentials, and these essentials can vary from person to person. They just need to things they need, something that will be useful and cherished by them on a day to day basis. For example, a man from the film proved this point by stating, “We’re living our life depending on the space we’ve got, rather than creating our space to fit our lives.”. Onto a more environmental benefit of this is that it greatly decreased the size of one’s environmental footprint. These benefits should make anyone want to become a minimalist, but as stated in the film, it’s not easy. It’s a process, which is probably the main reason why people wouldn’t even consider it, because this would mean giving up most of their “valuable” possessions. But once this process is complete, people will soon realize that the trade-off is well worth it.

I agree with your comment that material goods don't lead to a more fulfilled life. In fact, excess goods often cause extra, unneeded stress. Like you pointed out, the film minimalism came from a perspective of helping people live a better quality life. It's interesting to me how often times the things that are better for the environment end up also being better for our mental health. For instance, minimalism not only helps people feel less stressed out, but it is also better for the environment because it reduces consumerism. Similarly, natural products our better for both our environment and  our health. Gardening your own organic produce is awesome for the environment and its also awesome for our mental health because being outdoors has a way of calming our minds. These connections make me certain that caring for the environment isn't something we are should do, but rather something that we are intended to do.

The concept of minimalism is not a new term for me, I have actually found myself reading all about the lifestyle and have watched a good amount of videos regarding the topic. I was first introduced to people who live as “minimalist” a couple of years ago via youtube. Although I understand the many benefits to living with only the  products and items you can justify and consume on an almost daily basis, I have to admit, I find the idea to be a bit extremist. I applaud the many who have gone down the route of minimalism and are able to commit to such a sustainable lifestyle, as I don’t think I could ever personally reach a point in which I could filter every aspect of product consumption. I find that D’Avella’s film is a great introduction to this lifestyle as it focuses heavily on the individual benefits this “concept” brings onto ones mental health and overall happiness. It seems over the many interviewed, such as Nicodemus and Millburn, that they have pushed back from societal expectations and realized that success and happiness does not equate to how much it is one owns. The overwhelming message pushed through this film is that nothing other than our own culture accounts for our desire to acquire endlessly. Taking a step back to look at how much it is we consume, I can definitely see the positives in second-guessing what it is I truly need to purchase. It’s unfortunate that our culture favors excessive advertising and product placement, nearly everywhere we look we are pushed onto something we should be interested in purchasing. While I don’t disagree with the message pushed forward by the film, I don’t see myself ever becoming a minimalist or fully attempting this way of consuming. Personally a more effective “version” of this and probably for others as well would be to apply this to one aspect of our lives and fully carry the idea of minimalism in mind when consuming a certain type of product. Whether it’s stopping to think about how much or if we need certain amounts/types of clothing, food, technology, cosmetics or just about anything else, asking ourselves if we truly need the item vs simply wanting it can help us reduce our rate of consumption and ofcourse translate to markets, overall helping the issue of climate change through producing less waste and slowing down the effects of fast-paced productions.

While watching the film, I found myself fairly compelled to embrace this minimalist lifestyle expressed by the creators. Rejecting the inherent materialism of our society and economy sounded like it would, in fact, relieve much of the stress of life and teach me how to enjoy more of the "important things." I think on an individual scale, the embracing of this lifestyle can be really powerful for us, however I don't think it would be possible for an entire population to embrace this. This makes for an extremely difficult and somewhat paradoxical debate. Our economy, today, is touted as strong and booming when you look at the simple numbers, although I think this debate requires us to look at our economy and society on a much more fundamental level. An overwhelming minimalist movement would require us to practically abandon our current capitalist, consumer economy which our country thrives off of. If this were the case, it can be easily doubted that our country's financial strength would remain present. But then again, this wouldn't theoretically hold much importance to us. I know this probably all just sounds contradictory but I think that's because this proposal of mass minimalism would lead us right back to a similar situation.
<br><br>
I believe that, fundamentally, the human race strives for improvement and advancement. And without these achievements, I think there wouldn't be a whole lot to appreciate in our minimalist lives. So while, on an individual level, I think it is very appealing to try to personally "reinvent our materialist culture," it wouldn't be possible on a national level. In all honesty, I'm starting to believe that we might have just messed up from the start.

This documentary was very eye opening and it made me think a lot about what matters to me most in life and how I want to live my own life. I liked how the people in the documentary made it a point to help us realize that we all have our own lives and we, not other people, get to choose how to live them. Once we realize this, instead of climbing the corporate ladder to make more money to buy more meaningless stuff, we can decide what really matters to us and what we truly need, rather than what we want. The media is always displaying and promoting extravagant lifestyles full of expensive homes, sports cars and designer bags and clothes. People are literally addicted to their phones (according to the film, the average person checks their phone 150 times a day), making the media more accessible and visible to everyone. I like how the movie referred to this image of the “perfect life” as an illusion to what our lives should look like, making us feel like we need to make that our goal. However, we are basically on a treadmill that never stops moving, always wanting more than what we have and never being satisfied with what we have. We have to figure out how to either slow down the treadmill or completely stop it so that we can see that we need to stop chasing what we don’t have and start appreciating what we do have. 
<br><Br>
Living a more minimalist life can be healthy both for our own personal lives as well as for our planet. Becoming more of a minimalist can create a simpler and happier life with more purpose and value. An interesting point was made in the film about how in some ways we aren’t materialistic enough and that we really need to care more about the materiality of goods and not the status it puts us at socially. Thinking in this way will improve the way we feel about where we are in life and help us stop comparing ourselves to other people, something that almost everyone I know has a problem with. It will also greatly decrease the demand for stuff, therefore reducing carbon emissions coming from everything that goes into the extraction of resources, production, and transportation of making everything. Considering the extent to which we have harmed our planet, we are going to have to give up a lot to help it repair, but in the end, giving these things up could make us all a lot happier.

“There is a template out there you can call it the American Dream. That's just a template that is not thetemplate” When I first heard this quote it drastically stood out to me. This simple quote reveals one of the major issues within our society that has led us to be so materialistic. The American dream has drastically changed from people trying to pursue opportunity for themselves and their families to people striving to own bigger and better items that increase their status as citizens. This is a trend that has been developing for many years and is only going to get worse as more companies advance technologically and create a new product that “everyone needs”. We have become accustomed to having the newest and best clothing items, technology, and gadgets that it is going to be very hard to break this cycle and deviate from consumerism. We try to find fulfillment from buying into the newest fads and trends. 
<br><br>
Another aspect of this film that really resonated with me was the anecdote told by former Wall-Street Broker, Aj Leon. I found his story very interesting, yet I disagree with a few aspects of it. He made the comment that any dream he had of living a life of purpose and fulfillment, as well as being an adventurer would be gone if he continued his career on Wall Street. I do not believe this is entirely true. Having a 6-figure salary does not automatically mean you will find fulfillment from living in luxury and buying expensive physical items. I believe the fulfillment you get out of life is entirely dependent on the actions you choose to do to make you happy. While many rich individuals do live in lives of luxury, there are many wealthy people out there who choose to live simple lifestyles and use their money for other things. Not all wealthy individuals turn to buying things as a way to fulfill their lives. I understand why he made this comment, as the documentary is trying to persuade people to steer away from materialistic and money driven lives, but I believe his comment is not entirely accurate. Having lots of money does not require you to spend it on a luxurious lifestyle. I believe you can have a prestigious job and still find joy and fulfillment in your life from other sources.

I agree with you and have realized that the American Dream that I have always pictured was drastically changed from what the original meaning was originally. Everyone in this film found comfort in having less things and wanting less things. I, however, don't think that this is a majority of people. Someone just watching this film may think that the only way to be happy is to quit your job and downside drastically. I disagree with this for multiple reasons. If that is what makes you happy, then, of course, do that, but a lot of people have high paying, fulfilling career paths. I think that it's very misleading and slightly extreme to say that to help the environment we should all downsize drastically. Yes, there is a threshold where money no longer makes you happy and yes, we all have entirely too much stuff but the lifestyle laid out here in this video is not going to be for everyone. I also think that they could reach more people by taking a less extreme approach and only addressing things such as clothes or just addressing things such as housing. I think that to tackle this problem that we should first be starting with the image of what success is and then move on from there. If we can make success something other than materialistic things then we can move towards a more minimalist lifestyle. Also if we teach people to not be so caught up in what others think of them and are able to move away from materialistic lifestyles. This comes from a culture change that we would have to start and teach to future generations.

More than any other one I have ever taken, this class has opened my eyes, changed my opinions, and allowed me to look at my own life in a new light. This film contributes to this notion. I have always noticed how obsessed our culture is with ‘stuff’ and how ingrained consumerism is in our society. As the film mentions, from birth, we are conditioned through television advertisements to be in want of the latest and greatest, a simply unhealthy and detrimental cycle that continues our whole lives. I have especially noticed this in my short time here so far in college. While continuing on my path to declare a major, I have to balance my interest in the field with the usefulness of a degree in it once graduated. In order to be deemed ‘successful’ and to justify the fortune spent on attaining the degree, the job I get with my degree must pay enough that I will be able to afford the markings of success, a big house and a nice car. Once these goals are met, or once these materials are in my possession, I should be happy, right? 
<br><Br>
The cycle of consumerism reaches many aspects of life. It does not simply represent only the things we buy now, but it influences great life decisions and adds unnecessary pressures. In regards to the environment, living a life of simplicity and minimalism reduces waste and emissions, thus proving to be a very logical shift for society to make. If such a change will bring happiness to individuals and peace to the planet, it is a change that needs to be made. Although making this shift seems almost unmanageable, it is truly the most convenient time to do so, as society is already in upheaval and knows that a change to the gluttonous and self-serving way of life we have now is on the horizon.

I think you are not the only person has this kind of thoughts. I am come from China. Actually, in China, many parents require their children to have good grade, graduate from a famous university, find a great job, earn more money, buy good car and house. In their opinions, this is a chain process, and this is what can be called as high quality life.However, they are truly care about the psychological situation for their children. Are they satisfy with the decisions that their parents make for them? Are their satisfy with their current situation of their life? Are this kind of life is what they want? Are too much money could bring them unlimited happiness. In my opinion, wealth and social status are not the criteria of a person's value. As we live in this world, we need to live in the simplest way to get the maximum happiness. So how to find the simplest way of life. We need to give up our desire, desire to experience anything that could harm our environment and lead to more serious climate crisis.

As I sat there, surveying the objects I had around me, I all of the sudden felt crowded and weighed down by what I owned. It was all just stuff. Something to take up space on my desk. A leftover jacket that I didn’t have a hanger for. A stack of Tupperware in the corner that I’ve yet to use. A drawer filled with pens that are slowly drying up. So much unnecessary stuff. It became clear to me, after watching “Minimalism”, that none of these things really added any true value to my life. If anything, they might be slowly making me more and more unhappy, which is a revelation that the movie surfaces. As a society, we’ve built up and continued to reinforce consumer culture. For some, this has been a sign of our economic growth and the prize we get for dedicating our lives to developing skills that will earn us money. For others, this is a disease, and it’s slowly making us more and more dependent on superficial items, which is creating a race of addicts. We have it fixed in our brains that buying things equal happiness, so we take any opportunity we can to shop and spend. But this attitude is pushing us to live a lifestyle that’s making us increasingly more anxious and less fulfilled. Instead of being satisfied with what we have, we’re instead constantly wanting the next best thing. But can we really help it? When there are ads and social media bombarding our lives 24/7, it’s hard to not compare your life to the lives of people you see online. In 1983 companies spent $100 million on advertising to children and in 2006 that number skyrocketed to $17 billion. This is the only lifestyle that we’ve known since we were kids. 

<br><br>
 Although, just because something has been done for a long time, that doesn’t mean it’s the best way to do something. Living this type of consumer lifestyle is limiting us from ever being able to actually be happy with our lives, which is what Ryan Nicodemus and Josh Millburn realized. Ryan and Josh’s story is extremely motivating and almost provides hope for an empty and lost society. Seeing how someone who used to be so stuck in the corporate world was able to transition to a simple lifestyle with a clear focus was nothing short of inspiring. Just like most people, Josh lived his life thinking he was prioritizing the relationships he had with other people, but when his mom called him telling him she had stage four lung cancer, he realized that he was devoting his life to the wrong thing. Instead of working on and cherishing his connections with other people, he was busy trying to climb up the corporate ladder in order to get a bigger salary so he could obtain all the best things. This event in his life was truly what pushed him to change the lifestyle he was living in. I think that many people are in this same situation today. Telling themselves that one thing is the most important part of their lives, but never making any actions to work on that thing. This is our first world problem and minimalism is our first world solution, as Ken puts it.

If I had the money to support the consumer inside me, I would very well have every single thing currently in my carts across various shoe and clothing websites. Fortunately, I do not. And that is okay. Because after watching the documentary “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” I realized my life is way better off. Those items sitting in my carts would have added no extra value to my life besides temporary happiness and maybe a cuter outfit here and there. I really enjoyed this film because it genuinely opened my eyes to how little value a lot of the things I own have. It kind of gave me a reality check. It is so easy to get tunnel visioned into the constant advertisements, sales, and new trends that many of us fall victim to. And for what? I am genuinely trying to find a great argument of why I seem to need so much “stuff” and I cannot, because we don’t. I also respected the fact that the two minimalists were always very positive and uplifting with their message, and never tried to put others down or make them feel bad. They were simply sharing their stories in hopes that they could connect with a few people. What really brought their ideas into perspective was Courtney Carver, the founder of Project 333. She wore 33 items total, for a span of 3 months to work. After already being surprised that she could compile a multitude of different, and in my opinion, stylish outfits out of so little items, she proceeded to say that no one noticed... That goes to show you all these things we consume for the sake of trying to fit in, stand out, or whatever the case may be, doesn’t work as well as we may think or bring our desired outcome.
<br><br>
The film was a real eye opener and I am already going to wean myself away from the idea that I need so many things, and instead be happy with what I do have and understand that it is enough, and more importantly, I can live a very fulfilled and meaningful life without it. I wholeheartedly believe that reducing the importance of the consumerism culture would have a significant impact on our culture and the environment. However, I am very doubtful that this could be accomplished on a large enough scale to make a difference, but by all means, I do believe we should try and give it our best efforts. I always believe that any progress is better than no progress, and if we could turn to better options and resources to shop while also attempting to consume less, that would be a step in the right direction.

I think a lot of people will be confused about why we have to watch these videos, but I think it is very important. Yeah, the oil and coal industry was majorly used to develop America. But there are so many other ways that our consumerism is consistently taking from this earth. Think of the way we order things online, that package has to be shipped across the country or seas using fossil fuels. Minimizing our life will result in less buying, therefore, fewer packages being transported and less product being created. I think the idea coming from the video, “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” is a good idea, but more than likely won’t fall through in America. A plenitude economy means hiring more people and reducing the number of hours each person gets. That is the problem, the reduction of hours means less pay. Most Americans are already not getting enough money while working 5-day work weeks. These people are already minimizing their lifestyles because they have to, not for spiritual/ecological reasons. I think consumerism needs to be reduced from the people who are billionaires and have 5 different sports cars sitting in their 6 million dollar house. These people might have worked for their money, or it was handed to them. 
<br><Br>
The idea that less is more should be labeled across all televisions and social media. It should be taught that you work for want makes you happy, not to make the most money. Once people become content with what they have, they don’t crave materialistic happiness. It makes me think of a toddler who has nothing just a couple of blocks. They don’t care if those blocks are Gucci or from Walmart, nor do they think about how many more blocks they want. They are happily playing with what they have. We have been raised, not only by our parents but society, that brand names and having our own car is what brings you happiness. Not listening to the ocean in the morning or breathing in unpolluted air. Companies keep producing more products because they know we will buy it because it is advertised as a need. As stated in the “High Price of Materialism”, we are putting our earth at stake as the want for more materialist products increases.

The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things" was a very interesting choice of film for this class in my opinion, only because it didn't talk directly about climate change for very long. That being said, I'm very glad it was assigned, as I don't think I would've watched it otherwise, but thoroughly enjoyed it. The whole concept of consumer culture is such a new thing, and this movie highlighted well where it stems from. The "rich" yearly income has increased, the average size for a house increased, how many cars each family owns increased. When I think about it, this is all so completely unnecessary that it's actually absurd how much each and every one of us own. I'm definitely not a minimalist by any means, and I know this. But, this movie did really spark a curiosity in me. Could I do it? There was a line in the middle of the movie and I can't quite remember who said it, but it was talking about how we can't go on with this lifestyle and expect change with the climate crisis, then the man says, "the secret is, we won't miss it." That really struck a chord for me, because in all honesty it's similar to the Jim Carey quote they brought up, about how anyone rich and famous would say its not worth it. The truth is that no one can really know unless they have experienced it. No one can truly know what it's like to be famous until they are, and no one can realize how much they won't miss their stuff until they've gotten rid of it. Just looking around my room, there's so many things that I don't need. To be fair, I like what "The Minimalists" said about how, say you have a book collection that brings you a lot of joy, to keep it. They're not saying to get rid of everything, they're just saying to keep the things that serve a purpose or bring you joy, and to not consume just to consume. The point that was made about how consuming makes it seem like all the hard work you do is worth it, and it's true. Buying something with a hard earned paycheck makes the work feel less painful, but thinking about it, there are other things that have a much longer lasting impact than a new shirt. Money is necessary, and that's just a fact of our society, but it could be put towards a charity you really believe in, or maybe an adventure you've always wanted to go on. The man who was living out of his bag who had short stints in many different places had to have money to rent those places and get from here to there. That's engrained. The thing that's so sad to me is that this is such a large part of the climate crisis. This whole culture of consuming is, if anything, picking up speed. Social media has definitely heightened it; you get to see where people are, what they're wearing, etc. and it just leaves whoever is scrolling feeling saddened, and wanting that too. There are so many negative effects to humanity that these things bring, yet we continue to consume and consume and consume. This movie did a good job of not shoving the idea of minimalism down your throat, but just suggesting it and not giving definitive guidelines that must be followed. It's clearly a personal thing and everyone's idea will be different, but it seems as though it will cause a big change in not only the climate, but in mental health and wellbeing too.

I completely agree with your comment. I enjoyed watching this film because it was easy to follow and understand. A lot of the ideas and concepts that were mentioned made me realize the importance behind what we see in our daily lives. I always knew that companies and their advertising aimed at gaining attention and customers. However, I never paid attention to the 'why' behind all of the consumption. Throughout the entire film, the same statement was being made: purchasing more and more is not going to fill the void in us. I realized that people are so caught up with chasing what society deems as 'glamorous' or 'in style' that they just dedicate their life to working so they can keep up with the fast growing industries. Take for instance the statement that most caught my attention, "A lot of people aren't finding fulfillment in their jobs, and they need some way to tell themselves that it is worth it, that it is amounting to something more than a few numbers". This is a situation that I never want to be in as well as the situation I was raised to avoid. I do not want to rely on materialistic things to feel like I have succeeded, to feel like I'm worth something. The creation of new trends not only creates dissatisfaction with what we have but it also makes us think our used stuff is worthless, it not only destroys our true happiness but it destroys us as people and our society. This is not only an unhealthy lifestyle but also an unhealthy situation for our habitat, as what is making people unhappy is also causing the destruction of our planet.  
<br><Br>
With this being said, the concept of minimalism has gained a new meaning for me. I see it as the healthiest way of living. I realized that minimalism is not a radical lifestyle but rather a way of living deliberately. We have to learn how to avoid the manipulation that goes on and that is used against people to lure them in to even more unhappiness. I realized that I have to create my own template for what I want in life and stop aiming for the life that will only bring emptiness before it is too late. As it was mentioned in the film, "Love people and use things because the opposite never works", the opposite being loving things and using people. Since it is unlikely that our society will stop being toxic, we have to learn to gather the strength to back away from the unhealthy living conditions it brings.

I found that watching this week’s film, “Minimalism,” was an interesting, informative, and enjoyable film to watch. A point that the two friends made and a major takeaway for me was when they said that they ask themselves constantly of everything they own, “Does this add value to my life, otherwise[they] have to let it go.” After hearing this, I realized that I should constantly remind myself to ask myself the same question when going shopping the next time or cleaning out my closet for example. We live in a society that is obsessed with consumption. Our world, unfortunately, seems like we are constantly trying to compete with one another on buying the next big thing or buying an item just because its the hottest current trend. Many people use consumption as therapy and can be truly unhealthy. I know of a couple of friends of mine who can say they are guilty of this and seems that whenever they are most stressed out they can go from buying several items a day for weeks straight. Another example is my older sister who will still have tags on several of her clothes in her closet. I think the minimalist lifestyle is a good idea and should be given more attention to because having less stuff and wasting our money on items that are not necessarily needed but just “wants,” can be the already a small step in the right direction. A minimalist life will not only be incredibly beneficial to the person who is transforming into a minimalist life but for the environment as well.

I agree. Many of us are too attached to objects that will not give us happiness. We buy things that we think will make us happy but actually make us more unsatisfied. I bought some expensive earbuds a couple months ago because I thought they would make me happy. In reality, I barely use them and  
<br><br>
they just gather dust. It left me disappointed because I wasted money. I also wanted to buy an expensive watch because it looked really nice and prestigious. But instead, I decided to buy a cheap and reliable watch because they both function the same. 
<br><br>
I agree that minimalism is a good idea. Many of us have so much stuff but we barely use most of it. It's a waste of money to keep buying the newest phone since modern phones can last a couple years. It's really hard to resist the temptation of buying something you want but we should try to stop depending on stuff for happiness. It won't make you happy because you will always be hungry for the next biggest thing.
<br><br><hr><br>
I agree with your comment on minimalism. It was very interesting watching this video and really wondering how it’d be walking in those shoes. I feel as if watching it seems very easy, but with the way we’ve grown up in a materialistic society, it suddenly becomes a lot harder seeing yourself become a minimalist. I love the idea of not buying or keeping something if it doesn’t add value to your life. It reminds me of Marie Kondo helping declutter people’s houses by asking them to throw out anything that doesn’t “spark joy” to them. It seems kind of silly at first, but it really helps put into perspective how much you really need and how much you really use in day to day life. 
<br><Br>
I also have sisters like you who have month old clothes in their closets with all the tags on. I would get so angry seeing them do this because I would think of all the money they wasted and how much other people around the world would get so much more benefit out of all the clothes they aren’t wearing. Growing up though, I too got more consumed into thinking I needed to buy more things just to make me happy. At this point, society has done a great job in convincing us we need more things in our life to fulfill our happiness and dreams. So I see videos like these and I want to see myself in them. I want to be able to easily do the 333 challenge, but I look at my closet and it becomes so difficult. Honestly, I think it’d be so much easier if it were an assignment in some class so I’d be more encouraged to do it, which is kind of sad but I believe it’s what most people in today’s society need - a little push. 
<br><br>
In learning more of the benefits though, I think one day it’ll just come over me on how easy it is to switch to a minimalist lifestyle. I think it would transform my life and it’d be great knowing it helps the environment as well.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I also know people who purchase things that just sit around the house while their purpose is not served. I also know people who would rather purchase something that holds greater social value (i.e. fashionable, or brand name goods) for a higher cost than something that is cheaper, works all the same, but does not have that brand name factor. I think that ultimately capitalism is the driving force behind consumership, it has been made into the simple yet very effective and successful science of marketing. I agree that actually taking the time to assess our wants from our needs– and then our useful-wants from our frivolous-wants– would significantly increase happiness and improve environmental stewardship. 
<BR><BR>
I think that in regards to Ken's question, about if we can get more or all people on board, we can. I think that making it trendy can be an answer, I think that simple word of mouth can be an answer. Frankly, I also think that if our country does not create huge societal and structural change within the next few years the climate crisis will get the better of us. So we should try everything we can. I believe that asking the question of whether we can get all people or most people to convert to something is a bit ridiculous– "most" or "all people" are almost-never anything (if that makes sense). I think that we need to try everything we can, because it all makes a difference. A favorite quote of mine with a similar message from a movie called "Cloud Atlas": "My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?"

I really enjoyed this film and after watching it, I feel a sense of calmness and satisfaction. I have an urge to reach out to the people in my life who I really appreciate, and I have a desire to throw my phone out the window. That last part seems a little dramatic, but watching this film made me realize all the things I have in my life and my awareness of how I constantly am looking for more, for better, for something newer and exciting to fulfill some imagined desire towards satisfaction. I think as college students we are in a very rare and unique point in our lives. In Isla Vista, we cramp ourselves in these houses with an opportunity to practice minimalism and what it means to live off of what we really need. We get to practice each day on living communally and sharing sleeping space, closet space, fridge space, etc. with other people. But I think the problem is that people view this phase in their lives as just for a temporary period of time, when in reality this is how we could live for far beyond just the years of college. We work so hard in school so we can succeed in our degrees and then “succeed” later in life, in our jobs, etc. To succeed at the “American Dream”. But what I realize is that the way us UCSB students live now is incredibly practical, easy, social, and overall joyful. I feel very very grateful and lucky to have the opportunity to live in Isla Vista and start practicing minimalism at a young age in my life, and I feel even more grateful that I can take this class where I am exposed to these ideas of being a minimalist. I think if people looked more at aiming for success so they can experience more instead of consume more, then we would still feel empowered to work just as hard, but in the end we would feel happier with a simpler life. I want to be successful in life so that I can travel and experience things that I have not had the chance to while growing up. People need to realize that you can be just as happy without hundreds of shirts, pants, electronics, and space in general. Our world is so huge, instead of spending our brains and money on material items, we should spend it on going to new places, meeting new people, and consuming experiences and memories, something you can’t go and purchase at IKEA.

To answer Ken’s question if we could actually make maximizing minimalism happen, I believe we could if we have sufficient reasons to do so. My mom has always been an environmentalist in her own way, and I have always shown respect without fully participating with her. After taking this course, I’ve got another reason for me to become more consciousness about this environmental issue. The film, Minimalism, kind of serves as a pushing force for me to enforce a simpler lifestyle. As crazy as this sounds, when I was watching this film, I started decluttering my room. I packed up all the stuff that I didn’t need and decided to recycle them. I realized that I don’t actually cook anymore so what’s the point of keeping all the cookware and collecting dust? The opening scene of what I assumed was black Friday shopping was horrifying in a way to see how Americans are represented. I used to participate in this shenanigan but over the years, I’ve learned it’s just a tactic for merchants to get us to buy things without realizing the deals aren’t even that great. Happiness doesn’t always stem from money. It could be as simple as having a good relationship with your friends. I agree that our consumer culture has become an addiction. Everyone wants to be the trendiest in their friend group. They all want the newest products. And this kind of consumption is encouraged through technology, mainly social media platform in today’s world. AI is a really scary and complex system. I’m always paranoid that my phone is listening to me because they always pick up what I’m talking about with my friends and give me these suggestions through advertisements. The accuracy of these products is surprisingly high, considering only a few key words left my mouth. I think the act of buying parallels a toxic relationship. The best way to get yourself out of that situation is to let go and then you will feel happier and lighter. The last point of the film really struck me: love people and use things because the opposite would never work. In present day, this concept might be a lot harder to grasp as individuals are so willing to sell themselves for material goods such as cars or property. The idea of success must be shifted in a way where we can find joy in the simplest lifestyle.

I agree with your comment on Ken’s question. The beginning of the documentary showing the shots of Black Friday stampede shows the toxic traits of our materialistic society. Those images show how disconnected we are with what truly makes us happy and exhibit a hive mentality where we go to buy things we don't need just because everyone else is also craving it. On a day that should be spent being thankful for what we have with our families, people go cut that day short because they are not satisfied and want even more than what they have. Like you, I no longer participate in it because of how savage people act. I think living here in Santa Barbara, it's easier to live in a minimalist household because a majority of us live with multiple other housemates and are forced to limit to the things we absolutely need to live. 
<br><BR>
This class has also helped me be conscious of everything around me regarding the environmental impacts they may have. It will be much harder for the larger society to turn to a minimalist lifestyle because everyone follows the allusion of what our lives should look like. Everyone believes that to show how successful one is, they must have the best and bigger things in their lives, from houses to clothing. Our society is too materialistic and the sad thing is we don't stop to think about the ecological cost of fast fashion. We use up so many fossil fuels to make the things we want and to transport the things we want. Nature and villages in those areas are the ones being harmed because of our selfish need for more material things.
<br><BR><hr><Br>
First off, thanks for replying to my original comment. I agree with your point on the expression of the mentality where we buy things that we don’t need just because other people have them. This problem is further expanded with the rise of “influencers” whether on Instagram or YouTube. These so-called “influencers” advertising products that they won’t even use if the company didn’t pay them. Even if physically visiting a store isn’t trendy anymore, online shopping has been the ideal method for people that crave convenience. Big companies like Amazon that deem climate change more as a joke than actually help fight it are the culprit of where our society is heading. I currently live with 7 other girls. Even though it’s not the ideal living situations but when I think about how I’m actually helping the planet in some way, it makes me feel a lot better.
<BR><br>
I understand that some people might reside in the countryside after retirement in hopes of finding that serendipity and peaceful environment. I think these requirements can be fulfilled in certain parts of a city. Think about the convenience of living in a city compared to in the middle of nowhere. With the rapid change of better living conditions in urban areas, I believe a lot more people will choose to stay even after retirement. Fast fashion is definitely an issue that has not been solved yet. However, materialism spans for more than one industry… Technically, cars, houses, household items, anything that we use on a daily basis are being mass produced without being entirely consumed. The most important step is to understand that production needs to slow down and we need to shift our focus onto over-consumption.

The concept of minimalism is great and would do a lot to help combat this climate crisis. As seen in the film, not only does this concept help out our planet, but it also helps our happiness. The two minimalists in the film show viewers that a life of minimalism is very possible and it has helped them be extremely happy, even after dark times, as seen with Joshua. Of course it would be pretty hard for most people to commit to this due to all the promotion and advertising seen in the media by companies and celebrities, but I believe this is one of those cultural changes that is pretty possible. A great way for us to start adapting this concept is to realize that “things” are not what we need to be happy. What makes us happy is love within ourselves and love from those around us. As Joshua says in the film,”love people, use things because the opposite never works.”
<br><Br>
 The two short videos complement the film. The first video “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” presents the idea of a new economic model and a new way of living. This plenitude economy promotes that changing the way we spend our time is key to reducing environmental impact. With this type of economy we would have more workers and more jobs and less work hours. The video states that when people work less they tend to consume less, which would be really beneficial for our planet. I believe this economic model would be great, but I don’t believe we would actually switch to this. The second video is much more similar to the film “Minimalism”. The video also points out that the more people value materialistic things and goals, the lower their happiness and life satisfaction. I liked the example of the see-saw in this video, which shows how as materialistic values go up, pro-social values go down. This see-saw works the same for the concern of our planet. The video gives us two simple principles to change this materialistic society we have, and the video finishes by telling us that we must push for broader societal change to escape this materialistic culture. I completely agree with everything that was suggested in this video.

I found this film to be deeply moving and relatable. Growing up in Orange County, I have been exposed to a lot of materialistic people and things. I went to a private Catholic High School where kids drove Teslas and Porsches and had $800 backpacks. However, what I have noticed, and a message that the film tries to communicate repeatedly, is that money can't buy happiness. Some of the wealthiest kids I have met were the ones who were the least satisfied. I love how this film introduced a variety of people who practiced minimalist lifestyles. They didn't care about the newest apple product or car, and were perfectly content living basic lives. This has a direct correlation to our environment. The more we care about more extravagant and newer products, the more our carbon footprint expands. I believe if more people could practice this simpler lifestyle, we can have a better shot at halting the effects of climate change and saving our planet.

I did not like this movie. Although it had good potential and a good idea it mainly just consisted of a bunch of upper class people boasting about living like the lower classes. Coming from a family that had a large change in income and was struggling paycheck to paycheck, hearing these guys say they weren't happy making money just kinds seemed wrong. Those people have truly never had to go days without eating or had to work really hard for their next pay checks. It was like a Thoreau perspective, they are telling more upper class people how great they are for living like all of the lower class people all over the world. The people in the tiny house, sure your doing great by living smaller, but just think of all the people who live in spaces that small but with a lot more family members. I just didn't like the perspective they were trying to shoot minimalism in. It felt like an insult that they were writing books on minimalism and making money off of it when the majority of our world is suffering and already living minimalistically. I also don't understand how the two main guys weren't already more conscious about money coming from a poor childhood, they used to live minimalistically how did it take them so long to realize the importance of it. I just wish they had shot this movie from a different angle, like instead by talking about the importance of minimalism alone and its benefits, instead of showing interviews of various people who came from a place where they made a lot of money and were proud that they were living a normal life. Aside from the bad parts of this movie it did make some interesting points. Our cultures are revolving around stuff and a lot of people don't realize how severely it is hurting our environment. I liked the aspects of the movie that presented us with facts about minimalism, I just wish it wasn't so personal with the upper classes.

Watching minimalism I think at some point soon people will go full circle, and rediscover the beauty of simplicity. People have more things but yet are sadder than ever. It's only inevitable that people will put two and two together and realize that buying more things does not feel a void, but rather compounds the modern complexity of the world we live in. In this ever changing, quickly moving world, I think simplicity and clarity will be key to a happy, successful life. People will need to separate the signal from the noise, and the unimportant from the important as corporations, capitalism, social media and technology throw everything at them and require their attention and money.
<br><br>
Again, for this to happen people need to become more spiritually aware of themselves, and their needs. In some ways, the lust for more things is just a result of not knowing what you really want, or what really matters to you. People need to look into themselves, explore their spiritual selves and understand what makes them who they are. If they do this, I think they will seek external objects much less, as they will understand that what makes them and breaks them is already inside of them.
<br><br>
Lastly, I just think it's amazing how not only do corporations harm the environment directly through burning a ton of fossil fuels, but also indirectly, by brainwashing people into being mindless consumers, and motivating this overconsumption of things, which results in more of the environment being destroyed in order to obtain the materials and energy which will feed the addiction they have trapped them into.

I have never seen the documentary Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things before. I have to admit that I was astonished after watching this film. It is hard for me to imagine the lives of minimalists, who are out of reach from us. But in this film, I realize their existence and follow them into their simplified lives. It is a brand new experience for me, because I share the same feeling and enjoy the same thing with these people. I see them give up their extra stuff and start new lives without hesitation. I appreciate their courage and admire the power of minimalism. Without material, human can also live well. When these minimalists are interviewed  in the documentary, I see their happiness. Their feelings are so real that I cannot doubt them. Without material, human are also able to live well. I think it is time for us to reduce some stuff in our daily lives. Maybe we will have more new experiences and feel happy more often.

Minimalism doesn't necessarily have to be declutter all of your makeups, closet, jewelry or what have you away, it can started with buying less stuff which obviously you will never touch again in near future, maybe try to do so on Black Friday that is right around the corner.
<br><Br>
I have to admit I over-consume a lot of things in the past. If I find a piece of top looks good on me, I would take home every color of the exactly same style that I like to home, but seldom wear the ones beside basic colors. I used to collect makeup products as well as stationery which I think i'd better stock those things up and maybe one day i'll use them. I was wrong, I never touched those pencils or palettes in the corners of my drawers. With less consumptions comes less waste, and with less waste, we can at least leave our offsprings an earth in a slightly better condition.
<br><br>
Being a minimalist or not is a personal choice, but we have to realize that through all these times, we are misled by commercials and icons on TV, which depicts an illusionary life which in turn encourage the consumption. People need to grow their own judgement of whether it is a necessity to purchase it or not.
<br><br>
Minimalism is surely a viable and meaningful option, and people can choose to what degree they want to achieve to be minimal.

The film Minimalism talks about the life as a minimalist. The director shares his experience with people and spread out his idea of minimalism. He also shows audience the advantages of being a minimalist, such as having a less stressful, more enjoyable life. The director gives some examples of people who have a better life with minimalism. He expresses that minimalism helps people to see themselves naturally, getting rid of biases and comparison when living in a society. It is a great opportunity for people to see a true oneself. The purpose of the film is to appeal to more people to support and follow minimalism, having finite things we need and preventing buying unnecessary staff. The waste we produced is a serious environmental issue, and the carbon emission while creating this wastes contributes the climate change. Minimalism helps to solve this problem on a basic way: don’t buy it, thereby waste wouldn’t be produced. I strongly feel that the film is thoughtful. It tells an experience based on the life of minimalism. I feel these actions in the film are environmental friendly. Also, the director is doing useful work to protect the environment. The film lets me think about I can follow his actions because minimalism is a meaningful option. I also learn that having less belongings will reduce stress and increase happiness. It changes my attitudes on buying unneeded stuff. I believe more people will also follow minimalism to prevent buying more unnecessary products. After watching the film, I felt optimistic that everyone is able to become minimalist.

As I watched this film, getting a peek into the lives of various minimalists and their lifestyles, I found myself longing for the liberation of more material simplicity in my own life. I admit that I would not be able to cut down anywhere near the degree that they did; however, I think that I can take away a few key sentiments and translate them into the scheme of my own life. Firstly, I hope to have healthier spending habits by being more conscious of my purchases and deliberate with the material things I bring into my life. I find that I can be quite impulsive when it comes to spending and I’m hoping to change that by asking myself, “What does this add to my life?” In addition to this, I hope to cut down on some of things that I already own, enabling a Marie Kondo-esque mindset of  questioning whether my material things bring me joy and proceeding to get rid of those that don’t. Finally, I want to recall what The Minimalists said in response to someone who expressed that they have an extensive book collection and were having a hard time grappling with the idea of letting them go. They responded with, “Keep your books!” In the place of “books,” I mentally inserted “material things that bring me joy” as I was reflecting on my own life and the ways that I can be more minimalist. There is no part of me that is planning to get rid of every material good that does not contribute to my life in a necessary way. I merely hope to refrain from buying or to get rid of any material good that does not add to my life in some way, only being present for the sake of materialism. I believe that the message of this film was not to convert every viewer to intensive minimalism, but rather to be more conscious of the way that materialism dominates our society and our individual minds and to then draw the line as is necessary.

When I saw the title of the film I was excited to watch it and learn more about being a minimalist. I like to be organized and live and cluttered free life so minimalism is something I enjoy. Often I see how much stuff we have and how unnecessary a lot of it is. What I most liked about being the film is the couple with the kids that said to be a minimalist can be done in different ways. It’s not often living in one of the tiny houses but not buying as much. I liked that they were teaching and allowing there children to begin to live a minimalist life. As for this video I think that people won’t easily be able to transition to be minimalist but I do think it is something that needs to be implemented. We just all have to accept that we really don’t need a lot of stuff and be satisfied with a few items opposed to many.

I do agree with you, that I like being organized and living a clutter free lifestyle. However, I do not consider myself a minimalist at all. You can have a neat and tidy room that looks super bare, but you could be hiding all of your clutter in your closets. I do not think that minimalism equates to being organized, although it is a good start. The film “Minimalism” showed so many people, couples, and families living in small spaces and loving the quaintness and ease of their living space. I think that us as college students are in the perfect time in our lives to begin to implement minimalism into our lives, even if it is in small ways - we are all broke and living in communal housing right now, so why not continue it? In the film, they mentioned less clutter leads to less stress, which leads to less debt. I think all college students across the globe are in favor of less stress and less debt. As both Brenda and Ken (in his video) mentioned, it won’t be easy for people to give up all of their stuff. I do think that there are steps we can take towards becoming even a little bit more minimalist (or, a little bit less maximus), such as the “33 articles of clothing for 3 months” experiment shown in the film. This is something that any ordinary person, including myself, can challenge themselves to do which could lead to greater acts of minimizing our maximist lifestyles.

<br><br><hr><Br>
I completely understand that being a minimalist is not being a tidy and organized person. However, I don’t have a wardrobe/closet in my current dorm room and I fit all my clothes in 3 drawers. What I was referring to by being tidy and organized is that there isn’t clutter hiding in a drawer or behind a closed door. I do agree though that since we all live in dorms or cramped areas it helps us with the amount of stuff we keep. Like you mentioned challenging ourselves will make us better at being more sustainable.

Just by moving from my own personal room at home into a triple dorm room at college, I have understood the value and efficiency of the things I brought with me compared to the things I left behind. It's amazing how much easier it is to live with a third of the stuff I was accustomed to having before college. The film "Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things," really confirmed this notion that it is easier and healthier to live with only what you really need and enjoy. Reflecting on our American society as a whole, the Age of Consumerism began in the 1950s with the postwar economy and desire for goods and services has only increased since then. The fact that our economy is so heavily dependent on consumerism is wasteful, but it also reveals how ignorant many Americans are to the privilege they have. Not everyone gets to live the luxurious lifestyles Americans live and not everyone gets to spend such a large portion of their income on consumer goods. 
<br><br>
One thing that really struck me about the documentary was the fact that humans are wired to become dissatisfied. Consequently, there is a vicious cycle to have the next best thing in order to keep our interest. This is seen in the common concept of “shopping therapy” as a way to cope with our problems. This method of resorting to consumer goods becomes repetitive as we become more and more dissatisfied. This false notion of materialism therefore becomes dangerous as people fail to acknowledge the time and the resources that go into the production of every single thing they buy and don’t actually need. 
<br><br>
From a feasibility perspective, I believe that minimalism is good for the environment, but it is by no means enough to mitigate the impact of climate change by itself. This is because the minimalist lifestyle is a personal choice and it is not a choice many would make after becoming accustomed to the consumerism of American culture. If minimalism is used alongside other lifestyle changes that include eating habits, sustainable housing, and alternative methods of transportation, a person’s carbon footprint would be dramatically reduced. It is definitely something to strive for.

The film, "Minimalism" broadened my perspective on other ways of living. I find myself living the typical American consumerism lifestyle. I occasionally shop at thrift stores and consignment shops; however, I still get excited about new releases and going shopping annually on Black Friday. I try to be smart about my purchases but sometimes find myself being in the “you should treat yourself” mentality. Watching this film made me want to reevaluate and reorganize aspects of my life.
<br><Br>
I was shocked to see the closets of The Minimalists. Every shirt on a hanger had space in between each other. My personal closet has never had that much space inside. I probably have dozens of shirts in my closet that I haven’t worn in months and drawers full of useless items. Yet, I still see myself adding more shirts into my closet and more useless items into my drawers. One of The Minimalists mentioned that he loved every shirt in his closet. I don’t think I can say the same. I want to rethink my closet. Instead of having a closet full of shirts that are only worn a couple times a year, I want to declutter my closet to only include shirts that bring me joy. 
<br><br>
I can understand why a minimalist lifestyle is appealing. By taking out the unnecessary clutter and distractions, you can focus on the more important aspects of your life. It seems freeing to have less stuff to worry about. In addition to helping mentally, minimalism is also beneficial environmentally and financially. This lifestyle is a win-win for everyone. I think everyone can benefit from something in this video and I would highly recommend this for family and friends to watch.

When I reflect on my life, I also find myself living the stereotypical American lifestyle -- if I want it, I buy it. I constantly try to evaluate each purchase that I make, but it never truly works the way that I want it to. Every time I buy a new piece of clothing, or a package arrives at my doorstep, I am always filled with excitement because it is a new object that I can show off to others. Something about new items brings me satisfaction, but sometimes only for a short period of time.
<br><br>
Watching this documentary has made me admire the people who have chosen to live this lifestyle and actually stuck with it; I agree that seeing this film has made me want to rethink how I live my life and if all of my inanimate objects are worth it. They all seem extremely happy and content with the life they have made as a minimalist, and it makes me feel the need to change my lifestyle immediately. It is easy to see that their choices really have changed their mental state for the better, and I want that for myself. 
<BR><br>

This film has also reminded of a time when my elementary school teacher explained to my class that whenever her or her daughter buys new clothes, they must get rid of another piece of clothing, basically replacing old items with new items. Her comment has always stayed with me because I constantly find myself looking at my closet and thinking "Wow, I haven't worn this shirt in at least a year". Seeing this film makes me want to lead a better lifestyle, and my teacher's idea is a small step in the right direction.
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally relate to your comment. Whenever I come home from college I have a closet and drawers full of clothes and random items that I do not need. I have been surviving without the rest these stuff in college which shows me that I could easily throw them away without it making an impact on my lifestyle. But, unfortunately, many individuals are born as hoarders, neat freaks and/or money spenders which is a very addicting habit that they may never be resolved from a film. Also, many individuals were taught by their parents the idea of the “American Dream,” and/or getting educated for financial purposes in order to obtain everything they want in life. But, this idea is false because in this film it was proven that minimalists find greater value in life with having less. For example, Ryan and Joshua both achieved this so called “American Dream” through hard work but they found it extremely terrible and unfulfilling and left it all behind to try and live a minimalist lifestyle. 
<br><Br>
Minimalism is simple to accomplish because it is as simple as recognizing that you should throw away or donate items are are of no use and recognizing that you do not need to consume multiple items. But, their are individuals like me that was unaware of what a minimalism was until I watched this film. I knew that Individuals are constantly trying to keep up with new trends and appear “successful” but I did not know the positive impacts of minimalism. I found myself in the category of always wanting the latest iPhone as soon as it comes out (even though all cell phones basically function the same) and constantly buying new clothes to keep up with the new trends and fashion. It is challenging to be a minimalist because the media has a very influential way of portraying these items and even goes to the extent of persuading kids. The media advertises toys in a way that makes children believe that they can not live without it. This does not only go for children but grown adults too; individuals are addicted to shopping. People buy things because they are on sale or if there is an amazing deal like 2 for $5. 
<br><Br>
Through education and films like this, individuals will be able to achieve a clear distinction between their needs and wants which will ultimately help them find true happiness and a greater appreciation of the value of life. The idealistic standards of success and happiness is a false perceptions.
<br><br><hr><br>

I liked a lot of the points you made. Back at home, I also have a closet and drawers full of clothes and random knickknacks. I feel like I could live the rest of my life with just the things in my college dorm right now. I’ve noticed that because of college, I have become more organized. I think that is because I’m only living with items that are essential and items that I use frequently. I totally agree with what you said about the idea of the American Dream. My parents taught me that education is the key to getting a financially stable job to be able to purchase anything. I think having a financially stable job is important for supporting yourself, not for purchasing an excess number of items with disposable income. The Minimalists are right, sometimes less is more.

<p>
Before watching the film Minimalism, I was not expecting it to be so powerful. To be honest, I think it is one of the most powerful and influential films that this class has watched thus far. The reason for that is because the problems that Josh and Ryan were discussing about consuming related directly to me and I feel like relates to so many others watching this. When they said that they were working corporate jobs and were so unhappy with their life, even though they had “everything”, is one of my biggest fears. I feel like I’m falling into the system that produces people to live the “American Dream” by earning six figures a year, having a big house, and being able to live my life with financial stability from working hard. People aren’t finding fulfillment in their jobs so they spend in order to show that this job is more than just a few numbers in a bank account. But, this film showed me that there is more to life than just how much stuff you own and how much you make a year. 
<br><br>
Growing up and going to college as a first generation college student is difficult because I never really know if I’m making the right decision. Like I said before, I am scared that I will fall into the system of sitting at a desk job all day and everyday because many of the careers within my major (Mathematical Science), and I’m not really sure if I can even control that from happening. But, if you think about it, aren’t we all falling into that system right now as UCSB students? We’re all going to college to graduate with a major that interests us and, hopefully, work at a high paying job so that we can all live comfortably and maybe live a “better” life. But, what is that “better” life look like?  The film describes this as just an excess amount of stuff and clutter, because society is advertising that stuff brings us happiness, even though it never will make us actually happy. 
<br><Br>
I find it interesting that when promoting minimalism, the attention towards the idea that it would help stop the climate crisis was a very small point made in this film. I’m glad that they said it and talked about it, of course, but I also enjoy how they were promoting minimalism just to create a better quality of life. I was so drawn to this idea because everyone that they interviewed seemed so happy and free of stress because they were free of all of the useless stuff. As I’m sitting here, watching the film, I just keep noticing how I am apart of the consumer problem. I am disgusted. I shop a good amount, and then once I’m done I can’t wait to go shopping again, it’s terrible. I’m never actually buying items that I truly need. I feel like once I watched this film I am going to definitely look at how my life is being overwhelmed with all of my useless items and try to cut down on my belongings because I want the kind of happiness that people had in the film.

I think minimalism is a viable option in terms of lifestyles because like Ryan Nicodemus said, it is not a radical change. I truly enjoyed this film because of the refreshing and eye opening vibes it gave me. Minimalism is a meaningful alternative because like the people in the film said, they feel more refreshed and happier after. From the short films, it was said that materialism makes us less happy, more depressed, and selfish. This is seen in many scenarios where celebrities feel cluttered and unhappy after a while when fame gets to them. I think minimalism would make people more humble, making it a thing many people should try to pursue. Ken asked if we can reinvent materialistic culture. I think the answer is that it will be difficuly, but yes. From products we see now, they are very minimal in design. I think the consumer industry is trying to sell people the minimalistic look that people desire. This kind of goes against the whoole point of a minimalistic life because they are just selling more items that only look minimalistic in design. If people are already gearing towards the minimal look, I think we are steps away from people actually pursuing the movement. It can be done, especially in our generation, because we the young gneration already look for a minimalistic design and lifestyle. Therefore, my answer is yes it can be done. Cluttering will hopefully die with our generation, reinventing the materialism culture while will 100% be better for our lifestyle and environment.

<p>
After watching the two short films that depicted a plenitude economy as well as how being materialistic can affect our attitudes as well as relationship with the earth, I feel kinda gross. I was left feeling this way because I had previously thought of myself as someone who could be considered environmentally friendly. But now I feel bad for my constant craving of something new, whether that be a new phone or clothes. I could point my finger at society for making me this way or at advertisers for pushing their products on me but at the end of the day, I need to make the change. The constant craving for things that many people feel could also help explain why we associate objects with wealth. This is because we link nice new things with money and then proceed to judge others based on what they have. This cycle needs to stop or we’ll continue on being depressed and anxious, while thinking that buying new things will fix us. It may not be an easy task, everyone transitioning to a more simple lifestyle, but it’s a change we need to make and soon. 
<br><br>
  I personally think that the idea of a plenitude economy would be a good change for the U.S mainly because it would redistribute the wealth from the richest to poorest. I liked the idea of hiring an extra worker instead of having your other employees tired and overworked. The fact that this strategy has worked in other countries gives me hope that it’s something that the U.S could introduce one day.
</p><hr>


<p>
As the documentary kept carrying on I became more and more convinced that consumerism is what will ultimately lead to our downfall. As The Minimalists quoted toward the end of their journey, "love people and use things because the opposite never works". That quote really resonated with me. Sometimes, when I interact with other people, it seems to me like their only interest in having a conversation with me is how fruitful that connection will be to them later on. In other words, I feel like some people, whether consciously or subconsciously, form certain relations with others because they have something to gain from them, not because they truly resonate with that other person. In that sense, people now more than ever are "using" others because "using" is the central theme of the lifestyle we lead today.
<br><br>
I would argue that such a phenomenon occurs because of how deeply rooted consumerism is in our society. Since we always want to own more items and constantly buy more in the process, we have also adopted that mentality toward human connections. For instance, why is it that everyone wants to be friends with people who are successful? Although it's a crude analogy, rappers, for instance, always seem to cherish those that have always remained by their side before they blew up. On the other hand, they have a tendency to look down upon individuals who are now attempting to get close to them now. I think this is because they know that many of the people that come into their lives after their fame are superficial and the only reason why they even want to become friends with them is that they have something to gain from their success. We are so immersed in the culture of the American Dream that some of us have forgotten that success is also measured by the close connections we form with other people and our families. Like Joshua Fields Millburn mentions in the documentary after losing his mother, he realized that all the time he spent climbing up the corporate ladder he could have spent with her instead before she passed away. He mentions that for the first time in his adult life he was "sobbing uncontrollably" and could only tell her "I'm sorry" because he knew an important person in his life was going to be gone soon and I think he regretted not spending more time with her.
<br><br>

Overall, not only would a minimalist lifestyle reduce our carbon footprint and save our planet from the disasters of global warming, but it will also allow us to enjoy human connections a lot more than we are now. Instead of filling this empty void in our minds with useless material stuff, we will be able to form even stronger bonds with other people we love and have more money to spend on things we actually need. 
<br><br>

"La réussite c'est la fierté dans les yeux des gens que l'on aime" --> "success is seeing proudness in the eyes of the people we love"

In the past year, I’ve been having a pretty big internal conflict about my values and what I truly wanted out of life. I saw involuntary minimalism in action from when I went to Ecuador to help underprivileged kids. The culture was extremely different from the United States. Although the people there had so little (by our standards), they seemed so happy and every interaction was so genuine. This came as a bit of a shock when compared to the closed-off and stressed out vibes that many Americans exude. I realized this is because instead of the individualistic mentality that the US embodies, the values of family and community, were so much more prevalent. While the way to achieve so called “happiness” through individualism is with material wealth and success, human connection is what made the Ecuadorians happy. This is similar to the concept introduced in “The High Price of Materialism” where the video discusses how “as materialistic values go up, pro-social values tend to go down.” When a such a high value is placed on what car you drive or how big your house in, it is natural for happiness to always seem out of grasp. 
<br><br>
Knowing all of this, I know that I am happier when living in a more minimalist lifestyle. I felt the happiest I had been in years while living like a local in Ecuador, even without my phone or any social media. However, as much as I wanted to maintain these values, when I went back to the US, all my efforts seemed to disappear into thin air. This is because the way our society is set up, it makes it extremely difficult to actually pursue this kind of lifestyle without constant judgement and pressure to do otherwise. As much as I wanted to just enjoy life and stop delaying my happiness by devolving into a workaholic, it was near impossible with the constant pressure from parents and peers to “succeed.” In order for this lifestyle to be feasible for everybody in the United States, there must be a change in mindset and values. Hopefully this change can start with our generation before it is too late.

I think the film, Minimalism, is a perfect approach to bringing environmentalist ideals to our society. Your firsthand experience of living in both first and third world countries showcase the deception of success and happiness in modern times. Minimalism, whether it be for environmental or spiritual, challenges a person to choose quality over quantity, and embrace authenticity. One would think that Americans with their wealthier economy would be happier than underprivileged Ecuadorian children, but what I’ve noticed is that materialism is a learned characteristic. Materialism in America is taught at an early age, funded by the promise of economic and societal success. However, listening to the accounts of people in the film, a superficially perfect life is just that: superficial. Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Millburn encourage their audience to simplify and live an intentional life, rather than a perfect one. Consumerism engulfs humanity, and once one learns to separate contemptment from mindless achievement, they can begin to live at peace with themselves and their life. Becoming a minimalist creates a sustainable and balanced mindset, and connects us to what we truly value in life.. You can tell how much these people cherish what little they own, and who they surround themselves with. And I completely agree that it is so very important that our generation must make the shift towards living with long-term purpose in order to create change in our consumer-ridden, dying world.

After watching “Minimalism” in English 22 and “Visualizing a Plentitude Economy” I found that they echoed similar messages: our current way of living is not only unhealthy but unsustainable. Everyday we are overwhelmed by advertisements for unnecessary products that has created a culture of people believing they constantly have to consume. This belief has not only added to the exponential rise of our carbon footprint but has also created unnecessary distractions in peoples lives. Just as the film and video mentioned, people today are so focused on their job they disregard their own well being. Although I agree with the video’s call to create a new economic model and way of living, I don't see this as being a practical solution worldwide. While adopting a new economic model would be ideal, the current political climate will not allow for this. Instead I believe in change beginning at a consumerists level.
<br><Br>
         Historically, consumerists have always lead the market in creating a demand for goods so it is for this reason consumerists habits need to change in order for the market to follow. Living a minimalists lifestyle does not only promote an environmentalist consciousness but also develops a certain self awareness that deters the distractions and anxieties often created by society. I agree with you on the fact that too few people live a truly balanced lifestyle. I think if job hours were reduced a healthier lifestyle could be promoted which would be beneficial to society as a whole. I also agree that materialism has become a source of insecurity for many people, especially so through social media avenues. If everyone were to adopt a minimalistic lifestyle or even one that is more conscious of consumption, our environmental impacts will simultaneously be reduced.

I agree with you seeing as both the film Minimalism and both the short youtube videos bring up the fact that our love for materialistic things is not sustainable. The media is constantly bombarding our minds with the need to buy more and more. Owning a lot of things has become sort of a social symbol of one living the good life but as the High Price of materialism tells us the more you own the less satisfied you are. What’s the point of owning so many things and ruining our environment for something that does not even bring you happiness. Even if it did bring you happiness at what price is it bringing it to you?
<br><Br>
Americans are working more and more to attain that American lifestyle but that way of life has become a disaster for our environment. We need to start adapting a new economic  model like the plenitude economy. I agree with Victoria in the sense that it seems like a change to this economy seems impossible, but these changes do not have to start off big. You can start by changing things in your workplace or cities. We just have to start somewhere to get the ball rolling. 
<br><br>
I feel like going as minimalistic as the guys from the film might not be a possible reality for everyone but you can start off slow. You can stop purchasing things on impulse, clean out your closet and donate your clothes. Double think every purchase and ask yourselves if you really need something or if you can borrow it from a friend. Some people think that when making changes to lower your impact you have to start off big but you don’t. You want to build up to it because these changes should not be temporary but instead lifestyle changes.

I believe that minimalism is a great option for people. In America especially, we're surrounded by success: beautiful homes, cars, big families and paychecks. However, those successes don't promise long term happiness because they are external. It's the constant seeking that will leave people hungry for more fulfillment. Minimalism offers the solution to satisfaction in not materials, but in us, satiating the hunger for those materials we once desired.
<br><Br>
From an environmental perspective, minimalism could help reduce our carbon footprints. We wouldn't be consuming nearly the average amount and our spaces could be reduced, saving land for the local ecosystems. A minimalist lifestyle could eliminate many of the problems that we've created due to our material consumption.
<br><br>
I've considered minimalism in the past, but was never serious enough to actually follow through. The part that captivated me about this lifestyle was the amount of headspace I could give myself through having only necessary items. A cluttered space equals a cluttered mind. Keeping my space clean would be easier and it would be easier to keep track of my items. As a college student, moving back and forth between home, school, and other apartments in Isla Vista would be extremely easier.

I really appreciate your discussion on how developed countries such as America is living a successful life so far, while it’s vital for us to value quality over quantity. As suggested by the documentary, money doesn’t create more psychological happiness in return and we need to get rid of the idea of “bigger is better” or “more is better”. I quite agree with you on how a minimalist lifestyle will eliminate many of the problems we’re facing at present such as excess carbon footprints that add to the greenhouse effect. After I enter college, I start to pay close attention on every item I spend, whether it’s useful in the long term, and make budget for the next month. This is extremely helpful as I start to consume less on unnecessary items. I see people receiving hundreds of amazon packages from USPS or other delivery company and it makes me ponder upon the utility of these purchases, whether to gain a short-term satisfaction or not. Being a minimalism will definitely benefit the sustainability and save more space, cost and materials.

This week I watched the film titled Minimalism! I don’t know whether I am super impressionable because of my lack of knowledge about my future or what, but every week I tell myself I am going to bring these ideas into my life. For example, I have picked up a vegetarian diet, I have decided to only buy clothes from thrift stores or second hand shops, and now the idea of minimalism excites me as well. I found the film to be very interesting, I think it really showed a lot that the two main guys worked corporate jobs together and were both money and material hungry and gave it up to change their lifestyle and prioritize their unexplored happiness. Humans by nature definitely rate their happiness based off of the things that they have and the things that they want. When giving their talks to the audience one of the most captivating parts of their lecture was when they ask them “What if you had less stuff, less stress, less discontent, more time, more meaningful relationships, more growth”. I think on a surface level everyone would hear that and agree that they want that, but I find it interesting that if the tradeoff is breaking up with being a mindless consumer than it doesn’t sound so appealing anymore. Americans as consumers are a whole different species, the short clips that kept playing throughout the film of people tackling and fighting one another on black Friday or the employees clapping when the crowd fills the store is so twisted. We live in a society where people are literally getting praised for spending money and from it grows an urgency and competition to get the most “stuff” paired with the best deals.
<br><br>

Regarding Kens question in the video above, I personally don’t think it is possible to change our society to become more minimalist. We would have to recreate a society that rebrands what we consider to be important. Having a minimalist society would create a healthier planet and healthier people but recommending to people they give up most of the items they own is like asking people to walk away from their identity and their own version of established happiness. Unless this kind of lifestyle can be enforced it doesn’t seem like theres a likelihood of this happening. People are still so attached to this idea of an American Dream, the more things you have the happier you will be. I think the smallest thing that people can do to at least become more aware is like they said in the film, “live deliberately”, that every choice, every dollar, and every item needs to be questioned whether or not it is adding a deeper level of value into their lives.

I agree with your answer to Ken's question in the video. I do not think it is going to be very easy for Americans to give up many of their belongings for the sake of the planet. I do not think people care enough about the state of our climate to make such a drastic change in their lives. It also makes things worse that consumerism is a part of our everyday lives. Every day we see commercials on tv, and advertisements on billboards and in magazines for new products that we "need to have". However, one way I think we can try to combat this issue is by placing a less negative stigma on reusing and on secondhand items. Throughout the last few years, I believe our society has become more accepting of purchasing items second hand and It has become much more popular, but there is still work to be done. By simply purchasing even half of our clothing items from secondhand stores, we would be reducing the demand of the fast fusion industry by a significant amount. These corporations have such high demand for clothing that they are able to continue mass manufacturing clothes every day. By reducing the demand, they will not be able to sell as much product and will therefore begin to make less. Asking someone to completely minimize their life is a big stretch in our society today, but I think asking people to slightly alter their practices surrounding shopping is very obtainable and will have a pretty big impact.

Minimalism is a great idea in theory in my opinion, but will be very hard to actually enact in a society so deep into consumerism and materialistic desires. I think we should try to focus on buying less and living more sustainable lives because this will definitely benefit the environment and ourselves in multiple ways. But, I don’t think that we will get to a point where everyone turns to a minimalist lifestyle. Documentaries like this are very important because I didn’t really understand why people live minimalist lifestyles, but hearing about all of the benefits intrigued me a lot. I would like to reduce the amount of stuff I buy because of both the benefits for the environment, but also for myself. I think that I put a lot of unneeded stress on myself because of the desire to always follow the newest trends and not fall behind. I also realized that I literally wear the same clothes yet I have so many shirts in my closet that take up space for no reason. I am definitely going to take the clothes I don’t wear out of my closet and donate them. 

<br><br>
 Something that really changed my perspective on consumer culture was the video footage from Black Friday events around our nation where people literally fight for stuff they probably won’t end up using. The videos didn’t really shock me but just made me realize how crazy people get over such small things that will just cause them more stress. Another aspect of this is how people feel like they need to fill their homes with things just for it to look “homey” but they end up not even entering some rooms of their house. We buy things thinking we will use them or they will benefit us someday, but this is a very wrong way to live because in the end we realize that we don’t need half the things we have. This documentary really helped me realize how I have so many things I don’t even use and I can donate these things and live a less stressful life. The difference between the people shown in the documentary before and after they made the switch to a minimalist lifestyle is crazy; their attitudes on the true meaning of life, the values they really want to spread, and their overall happiness completely changed for the better. 
<br><br>

Although I don’t think we can really change the economic model we use (capitalism) in the near future, I do think everyone can try to change their lives by not giving into the consumer culture we grew up in. This will help us be stressed a lot less and overall happier in the short and long term. Minimalism has an impact on many different aspects of society and seems like a great way to fix our earth and ourselves, I just think not enough people know about it for now. If this changes and people see the true values of this lifestyle, the minimalist lifestyle can be very widespread.

This film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” was incredibly enjoyable to watch. Hearing their stories and knowing where they came from made them more relatable and I could see myself living a lifestyle like them. To me and many people who I have spoken to, their goal in life is to be successful and most likely that success is based on making a lot of money in order to do things they like and buying things they want. In my own personal experience I have always wanted to be successful and make more money so that I could finally go out and buy the things that I could never have or afford when I was younger, I wanted to buy the clothes I could never have or go buy the next best phone or appliance. But as I was watching this film I realized that all those things are not very useful in my daily life, sure they would definitely be nice to have and they would make me happy for that moment but how long until something else came out and I no longer cared for what I had worked so hard for and just kept moving on to the next best thing? And do I really want and need all these things or are they just being forced down my throat and pushing this lifestyle on me by the thousands of ads I see on the daily? It was also very convincing and moving to see that these people who decided to live a more minimalistic life started with a life that many would claim as successful but they were very unhappy with that lifestyle and even described it as being “trapped” and that is something that I would hate to see and feel in my future.
<br><br>
Living a minimalist life, like they said in the film is not a “radical” movement. To me it seems logical, why would I have multiple similar things if they are not useful to me? And I especially like how they approach it in a non aggressive way. They're not telling you to throw everything away and just live with a mattress and one set of clothing, but instead they are asking you to evaluate everything you own and question if its adding value to your life. I think living this way is definitely not easy but it's also not impossible to attain, the hardest part I think would be in trying to convince people to let go of some of their stuff. Like Ken said in this video you would also have to pay attention to where you buy your clothes and where they are being manufactured but I do believe that by having less stuff it is a step in the right direction.

You raise some really good points! I also really like the fact that they wouldn’t necessarily describe being a minimalist as a radical movement. When it really comes down to things, the idea of minimalism is not to promote a specific agenda or self-interest. In fact, the idea behind it is to truly and honestly assess the things in your life to find your own sense of contentment and value of things, and I really like that about it. At its core, it is hard to argue that minimalism is a bad thing to do. But the consumer culture that is so embedded in the American lifestyle makes it difficult for us to even conceive the idea of throwing away your stuff to lead a simpler life. Before the documentary, I would not have considered myself to be a materialistic person whatsoever. I grew up not really having much but the necessities, and all the extra things that cost money never really appealed to me because I knew that I could live without them. However, coming into college, I began to feed into the capitalist mindset. I began to gear my studies and career path towards whatever would make money in the future, and this ultimately led to even greater stress and anxiety in whether or not I would be able to make enough when I was older. I do not, however, think that having things means that you are being materialistic. I have a nice laptop and phone, but this is a luxury that I am aware of and deeply appreciate. Minimalism to everyone may have different degrees, but I do think that it is an important lifestyle because it attempts to steer clear from the consumer culture that is pushing America to deplete all of its resources and promote a culture that does not value anything but the idea of wanting more. 
<br><br>
A very sad thing that they brought up in the documentary was all the advertising that they gear towards children. Even from a young age now, we are being primed to feed into the consumer culture, and it is only getting worse with each generation. Although the documentary was not primarily focused on the environmental benefits of minimalism, we can only imagine how the future generations will only be more inclined to consume more and contribute to global warming at unprecedented rates. It is kind of pathetic how modern advertising and consumerism are so invested in hooking people on buying the newest and hottest things. Although I do like minimalism as an individual solution for fighting climate change, I believe that it is even more important for people to at least try and live this lifestyle for the personal values it aims to promote. Seeing how many of the people in the film have found more satisfaction by leaving their life of money and materialistic things, makes a compelling argument that living with more things does not necessarily mean a better life. Plus, it’s better for the environment and reduces your carbon footprint significantly. What’s not to like?

After watching The Minimalist I think that minimalism would not only be beneficial for our environment but also our well-being. Our society has been built upon this concept, as Jimmy Carter said, that, “human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but what one owns.” Since a young age, we are exposed to advertising everywhere we look. One thing I found interesting was that as humans we were evolutionary programmed to crave more millions of years ago, as a means for survival. However even though now we have everything we need to survive, advertising companies use this craving for more to their advantage to sell more of their product. Instead of focusing on what adds value to our life, we focus on the idea that buying more to show off our wealth will make us happy. Milburn and Nicodemus argue that this life of constant pursuit will make you miserable, and by living simpler lives we can focus on the things that really matter, like our passions and relationships. 
<br><br>
As a society, if we are going to curb the climate crisis, we need to focus more on our consumer culture and less on hoping technology will fix our problems. We need to accept a minimalist lifestyle to reduce our carbon footprint and by doing so I think we will all find more happiness in our lives. For example, this year for Christmas my family decided that instead of stressing over gifts we were going to use the money for a trip instead. This Christmas actually turned out to be my favorite because I wasn’t focused on the material things, but instead seeing more of the world and spending more time with my family. I think that once our society gets past the idea that our items do not define us and adapt to a minimalist life, we will realize that this is something we can easily do. While it will be difficult to get everyone on board, I think that we

Minimalism is the most eye-opening film I have watched in years. It has inspired me to look at the material world in a completely different way. 
<br><br>

What struck a chord with me was the idea that people live for paychecks and live for stuff -- but aren't actually living at all. 
<br><br>

I don’t have a job yet, but I often question the value of college and careers and everything like it. I see the numerical value in these things, but I don't see any other value. This makes me feel restless. I often look at the ads, stores, and restaurants around me and I get sad. I see the superficiality of it all, yet my life is consumed by the consumerism. My life is unfortunately worth a dollar amount. And that's terribly limiting. 
<br><br>

This film introduced me to the idea that everyone has the option to turn it off. 
<br><br>

One guy in the movie asked “How do we go from working all throughout a lifetime to enjoying a lifetime with a bit of work here and there?” The same guy later said that "part of why we consume a thing is because we work for so long. People can’t find fulfillment in their jobs and they need some way to tell themselves that it’s worth it." They buy a car or a big house and they can say "see? All the hard work is actually worth that number in the bank account." 
<br><br>

This reinforces the idea that happiness stems from actually doing what you love!
<br><br>

Another guy said that below a $70,000 salary, adding greater material well-being is linked to greater psychological well-being. However, once you push past that threshold, you can have more money but you’re not going to become happier. 
<br><br>

Sometimes I think about my ultimate dream: to become an actress. I don't care about how much money I make in the future -- I just want to study scripts and express myself and participate in the art of filmmaking. For years my family has told me that being an actress would be a great struggle. I agree that I could struggle; however, that struggle would only be if I attempted to match what is considered normal living in the US. However, by looking at the world through a minimalistic lens, I would be able to do what I love, never worry about making a living, and be happy. Instead of living for a salary or living for stuff, I’d finally just be living.

I really enjoyed watching the Netflix documentary Minimalism. Particularly how the two main speakers Joshua Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus talked about how for years they tried climbing the corporate ladder, in the hopes that it would bring them fulfillment. They both shared the struggles they had gone through as children and explained that because of this they wanted a better life for themselves. One that was full of all the luxuries they did not have growing up. However, both discovered that this was not fulfilling. This search for fulfillment led them to the path of minimalism. I really admired their story and how they traded in all their luxuries to spread the word of minimalism. I had heard about minimalism before and have always respected the idea of living with less. Though this is something I have been trying to implement in my life I never thought about it to this depth. Something that I am going to try is project 333. This is a challenge to only wear 33 items over a 3-month period to see what you wear and what you don’t wear. The things that you don’t wear can be considered excess and should reconsider its purpose in your wardrobe. I like this challenge because I think its something that everyone can do even if you cant fully commit to the minimalist lifestyle it’s a step in the right direction. In response to professor Hiltner, I do think that minimalism is something that is needed considering how bad consumerism is for the planet. However, I don’t think everyone is able to or willing to make this type of change. Just the idea of living with less, even if not to this extreme, can be a good step in the right direction. If more people can just buy less we can eliminate a lot of the waste that ends up in landfills and in our oceans. I personally liked the interview they did with the news broadcaster who shared his journey with minimalism and how he experienced self-growth and peace by living with less. By constantly trying to get more and fulfill this “American dream” he felt such pressure that it caused a mental breakdown. He found help through minimalism and meditation. I think this story is a good example of taking control of your life by living a life of less. This is the freedom I think Hiltner was discussing in his video. By having more and constantly reaching for more, you only create more stress in life. By not feeling pressure to have more you actually get rid of unnecessary stress.

I was really inspired by this film and started to do some of my own research about minimalism. The director this film actually has his own YouTube page. Matt D’Avella shares really great tips for how to transition into minimalism and do it in a way that fits with your lifestyle. I suggest looking at his YouTube page if you are interested in learning more about this!

As soon as I started watching this film I instantly thought of my housemate who is also one of my really good friends. She is one of the many who easily falls into capitalism on a daily basis. In the beginning of the film, one of the minimalist mentions how he was living paycheck to paycheck and was still using his money to fill his addiction on buying stuff. My friend has done the exact same. Literally just last night she was already adding stuff into her shopping cart for when her next paycheck comes in, and this occurs on a very frequent basis. I am not mentioning this to talk crap on my friend but as an example of how people fill their void by buying lots of stuff; they need to make consumer purchases in order to feel content in their life. I’m not going to sit here and front and make it seem like I don’t fall into capitalism myself - I also do make purchases here and there but over the past couple of years I have outgrown making dumb purchases on things that I don’t necessarily need. Material possessions don’t interest me as much as they did during my high school years. Once I fully understood the concept of capitalism and how it harms us , this hunger for materialistic things are no longer there. Buying crap that you don’t need is not worth the environmental harm that is causes.  This is why it angers me when advertisements attempt to trick people to believe that you need to buy these things; they are focused on only one thing and its money. These companies are extremely powerful and do a damn good job with using that power to convince the public that they need to fit into the status quo in order to be accepted. They are not realizing the harm that they are causing and they do not care to realize.

I have witnessed very similar scenarios with my friends. After watching the short film “The High Price of Materialism”, it was clear to see how destructive materialism can be to one’s mental health and overall happiness. I have had friends on both spectrums. One of my friends is very similar to your housemate, working endless hours to afford both a college tuition and rent. However, whenever pay-day comes around she doesn’t think twice about finding a new outfit from a fast-fashion company online in order to sport her new clothes on the weekend. Whereas, my wealthier friends, who casually drop cash on materialistic items on a day-to-day basis, happen to spend a considerable amount of money on destructive substances like drugs and alcohol. Many of the extremely wealthy parents I know spend a large sum of their time and money on materialistic pleasures; however, they seem to be more miserable as they are constantly looking for more in life stuck in the cycle of materialism. With this, they miss the bigger picture, the true values of life through simple pleasures and leisurely activities they intrinsically value. As the film “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” suggests, if the average person spent less time working, and more time exploring what life has to offer outside of the workforce, I am sure they would get more out of it. In the video, it is also inferred that they would consume less, as their motives are less concentrated on materialistic objectives, and more so on what makes them happy. This equation seems simple, and has been iterated often in society, yet most do not follow this lifestyle. I think it is necessary that we try to take more time focusing  on ourselves and the people we love, and less time consuming things which is oftentimes an easy distraction. In solution, we must consciously act on this social issue because it is so ingrained in Western culture. In return, the less we spend on consumer products, our wellbeing will increase and environmental destruction will diminish. Like you said, companies are skilled at luring consumers into wanting more than they have. However, this is obviously not what we need; in the long run it will further turn us away from our humanity and continue to instill bad habits that are destructive to our planet.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
To start, I love how you are kindly putting your friend on blast, I’m sure she would be the first to admit that her shopping habits aren’t the best, which makes it even funnier. I think that the majority of us would admit that our shopping and consuming habits are not the best, and although it is in our control to change it, that is the way we were raised. The American way of needing to have the newest or best product naturally rubs off on people growing up, but one quote from the documentary referring to that stuck out to me… “that’s just A template, it’s not THE template.” Just because we are used to wanting everything and more does not mean that we have to live that way in the future. I have tried to make an effort at not necessarily becoming a minimalist, but just being more cautious of how my decisions affect the environment and those around me. My favorite store (and literally 90% of my closet) is Forever 21, which is a horrible store when it comes to fast fashion. But for so many years that was my go to store because it had cute, trendy, and most of all inexpensive clothes. I now realize that because I was not paying a high price for my clothes, the environment was paying the price for me. 
<br><Br>
The reason I think that the documentary and the Minimalist guys resonate so much with the public is because of how they present it. Forcing this upon people would make them oppose it strongly. Pushy is exactly what turns deniers further away. Even though climate change does require urgent action, we must go about this is a smart way, which would not be forcing people to alter their lives in drastic ways. Slow, practical movements will lead to progress, not pushy, forceful ones, which I think the documentary is a great example of. Lead by example not by force.
<br><br><hr><br>
I very much agree that those who are in the repeated cycle of spending large sums of money on consuming materialistic goods are miserable. They don't know what else to do with their money so they automatically gravitate towards buying unnecessary stuff. In today's time, we make success and consumerism go hand in hand with each other. So those with money fill the need to make these purchases to show off that they have money and that they are successful because otherwise what is the point in them working hard everyday? These people bust their asses working endless hours to have these nice things because it is part of our culture now, which is sad to admit. Also, when you mentioned if the average person spent less time working and more time exploring, I couldn't agree more but nowadays I don't think the average person knows what it means to explore. When one has the day off and wants to go do something it's typically going to the mall/going to shop. I know multiple people who go shopping all the time when they're bored or there's nothing to do, when instead there's so much more to life than walking around a shopping center.

I haven't seen any information about Minimalism before, so my previous views on Minimalism have changed. I used to think Minimalism was just about not wasting and spending less. Now it seems that the previous idea is very wrong. In my opinion, the Minimalist way of life is to recognize yourself once again, fully understand what you really want, and then use limited time and energy to pursue these things or ideas, from then on to real happiness. By giving up some pursuit of luxury goods, we can control our own desire, understand our own desire from people, so that we can not be influenced by outsiders or society, and put all our energy into our own ideals. Of course, after doing these things, the demand for materials will be greatly reduced. We will only get some necessary items to meet our daily life, so we will not waste them, and we will also greatly reduce the cost. Combined with what we have learned in the past few weeks, minimalism has great help to the current climate change issue, which will gradually affect people's views on environmental issues.

My views on minimalism also changed after watching this documentary. In today's society it seems that all we care about is achieving the picture perfect life. We want to wear the trendiest clothing, and having designer shoes and bags because that is what society makes us believe. We constantly come across billboards and magazines trying to sell consumers a certain product by implying that they will be happier once they have this product, and most of us fall for it. Buying new clothes feels good because you want others to notice, so at the end you are doing it for someone else and not for you. After watching the film, I started to look around and see all the things I deemed important enough to bring with me to college into my small dorm room where I share a closet. I thought that it was important to bring several tank tops, shirts, jeans, shorts, and shoes when in reality I don't even wear most of the things I have in my closet. We really need to put our lives into perspective by asking ourselves if the things that we have and the things that we buy are going to add value to our lives and if it truly brings us joy. Project 333 is such a great starting point that can help those that have never thought about pursuing a minimalist lifestyle come around to the idea. While cleaning out your closet can't significantly reduce carbon emissions immediately, moving into a smaller house or having a more eco friendly car than a sports car that all your friends would be jealous of can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. As a society we need to stop falling for the traps that are set out for us and make us believe that we will be happier if we own more things, because money and objects can not buy happiness.

I really do not purchase that much clothing. I rarely go shopping, I find that it stresses me out, and often I do not have the disposable income to just be buying things left and right. So why do I still have so much stuff? Before leaving for my freshman year of college, I went completely through my entire room. I threw away and donated piles and piles of stuff, more stuff than I could ever have even imagined me having. I found my snowglobe collection from elementary school stuffed in a drawer in a back corner. Why did I still have that? Even after ridding myself of so much clutter, when I came home for Thanksgiving break I realized that I still just had so much stuff. One girl does not need that many tiny tops and sweatshirts. The same issue reigns over my dorm room here. In this moment as I write this, I am staring at a drawer filled so fully to the brim with t-shirts and pajama pants that they spill out over the edge, unable to fully close. Same with stuff on my desk: a drawer is filled with old papers, a flashlight, Halloween and Christmas cards from my grandparents, full of all the random things that I think, “I might need that one day.” or “That’s from my grandma. I’ll feel like an a**hole if I throw that away.” but I still don’t think I have a problem. And it’s true: I really don’t buy anything for myself anymore. This is all an accumulation of years and years of consumerism and materialism that used to eat at me. Now, I feel that I really don’t consume more and more today, I hold on to what I have bought in the past that still works. In the documentary, they mentioned that as a mark of the terror of fast fashion: make something not trendy, make people feel as though they need to buy more and more faster and faster. I’m proud that I don’t fall victim to that targeted message. I do see my friends comply with the consumeristic mindset quite frequently. That’s the life of a teenage girl today. Insecurity is preyed on as my friends follow models and Instagram baddies on social media who promote brands and tell us to buy, buy, buy. Every themed party is an excuse to order something new. 
<br><Br>
 I really appreciate how these people could give up all the stuff that they felt cluttered their lives and left them with feelings of stress and dissatisfaction. I love that they were able to find inner peace and walk away from the path that laid before them, one of corporate “success” plagued by false material satisfaction. But minimalism just isn’t quite my style. My walls are covered in posters and photos, pieces of art my friends and I have created. My desk is cluttered with mementos from the places I have traveled. My bedside table is filled with books and candles and jewelry. I like my organized clutter. But maybe this is the perfect example of how I am part of the problem.

After watching this film I believe minimalism is one of the most important factors in trying to combat climate change. The film establishes a lifestyle change that makes people's footprint much smaller. The only reason firms continue to produce is because there is a demand for the products and consumers continuously buy more and more. If consumers just didn’t buy then firms would no longer be making as many goods. Consumerism has become normal in our lives and many believe that it would be impossible not to consume considering the lifestyle that we have now. We must buy everything in order to eat, live in comfort, go to school, basically everything that our daily life revolves around. It would be very hard to completely stop consuming because some of these products make our lives much easier that is worth the pollution externalities that these goods produce. In the film, they also touched on advertisements making this fake idea that products will lead to more happiness, however materialistic things is not a path to happiness. Instead, happiness will unravel once you are already satisfied with what you have.  Another way to minimize is to live in smaller houses which is something that is available to most people and would not compromise a person's life based on necessity. A person’s life based upon comfort and luxury may not like this but there is no excuse that they need a large house. This film is very important to watch especially in today’s society where fast fashion is huge and new products are being produced unnecessarily. This makes more and more people want more which is only making the environment much worse.

“Minimalist” is not a new word to me, but this movie definitely brings some insights to me in many different ways. I really like it’s explanation of why people start to crave for more and more things: they want to live the way other people do, or the way the advertisements shows. They would follow the styles of celebrities, purchase new products that they don’t really need, or get enormously large houses. However, the question comes up is whether we truly enjoy or need to purchase that many things. As it says in the movie, some would expect that money buys happiness, while others feel like having fewer stuff allows them to not to be materialistic. 
<br><br>
I’m surprised to see the minimal houses which are also neat and well-organized. The heat map shows that basically people end up wasting a lot of space in the house, and dining table is the most typical example. Even though the living space has increased to three times it used to be, storing becomes harder and harder, and there are more storage companies out there to provide storing spaces for people. One of the main causes of this issue would be fast fashion industries. The point of fast fashion is that is allows people to purchase at cheap prices and throw away clothes not when they can’ be worn anymore, but when they lose their social values. This problem is closely linked to climate change, for the production produces a lot of greenhouse gas. Therefore, minimalist seem to be a doable solution to this.

I feel like growing up, I've always heard the word minimalism, but I didn't really get it. I saw minimalism as just the aesthetic of white bare walls and grey rectangular couches. It wasn't until these last two years that I started to understand minimalism. Now, I'm a huge believer in cleaning out the mess in your physical life, as a way to clean out your mental one. But, it's still hard. So much of culture is trying to make us buy more and more. I find myself fall prey to that pretty often. I would suggest cleaning out your Instagram feed, before cleaning out anything else.
<br><Br><hr><br>
I wonder if I had a heat map of home, could I do anything with that information? Or would I just know that space isn't being used? I love the idea of using space for multiple purposes and do want to implement that.

I have recently been trying to skip fast fashion but also ohmigodireallylikeclothes. I love building outfits and having photoshoots. However, I think the use of thrift shops (both for buying and then reselling) can help fix this problem.

Minimalism had an interesting take on how to help make an environmental change. While the primary focus of the film wasn't environmentally focused, I found that the main reason why the creator of the film chose to go the minimalist route as a way to improve their mental health. I agree that American culture influences many Americans to believe that their happiness is just a few dollar signs away. However,this never turns out to be as satisfying as we think it will be and thus we continue to look to buy the new phone, better car or bigger house. I think minimalism leads to happier lives because people start to appreciate the things they really need. Thus leading to only the consumption of the things you truly need in your life. Personally I feel like the transition toward minimalism would be somewhat hard for me. This is because I might misinterpret what "the Minimalists" said about keeping the things you have a purpose for. I think I would begin to find reasons to keep objects around based on the idea that I might one day use them. Environmentally I think minimalism is a great way to slow the rapid consumption that has lead to our modern day issue of the climate crisis. Minimalism would steer people in the direction of using reusable products as part of their select number of items to use in their lives. I also think it would give people a better appreciation of nature and the world around them. Hopefully people will be less focused on their possessions and be able to see and feel the natural world around them. I don't think minimalism, as a main strategy to combat climate change would be very effective. Yet, when used in combination with other environmentally friendly choices I think it can help turn the tide. Most importantly though think minimalism helps the world as a collective, as people become happier and the world becomes "cleaner" without as much consumption.

It is clear that in our society, especially among the working class and older generations, people outrightly prioritize money and jobs over the environment. I’m sure that if I asked my dad, who buys his merchandise from China, what he thinks about reducing carbon emissions in his company, he would completely dismiss it. I think that, unfortunately, this applies to everyone, from underpaid employees who work long hours to wealthy citizens who come from old money. Most of humanity would sacrifice the cleanliness of the planet in favor of making an extra buck. That is the society that we live in. In this first video, a solution is offered that would reduce work time from 5 days to 4 days a week. Here, an employer would take on another employee and everyone would work 80%. The Netherlands is an example of a government who accomplished this. While I do think that something like this is feasible for countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, for example, I don’t see this happening in the United States. Many of the countries that would be able to commit to a plan like this are less money-hungry and are willing to cut back on cash and opt for small scale production in their homes or things like going out more. If Americans have the option of making more money by working another day, I don’t see them passing that up. Until something changes at the core of our society that inspires people to purchase less and live more humble lives, there will be the same competition in America that leaves people unsatisfied.

Minimalism is not a distant
word and I’ve heard minimalism which is popular in the united states so many
times, but I want to ask how many people are minimalists or have a tendency
toward a minimalist lifestyle. The film “minimalism” uncovers people are
addicted to fashions or many unnecessary commodities. I understand that
nowadays people are trapped in consumerism culture. Sellers inculcate
consumerism to buyers in order to sell more commodities. In China, many women
who have had economic independence are encouraged to buy cosmetics and cloths.
In fact, they do not need a lot but are badly influenced by consumerism. To
protect the environment, it is asking everyone to be a real minimalist but to
buy less commodities that you may never need. Plus, money doesn’t buy
happiness. The more commodities you have, the more commodities you want in the
future.

In the first video “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy,” they point out that one of the main problems that lead to excessive CO2 emissions is sustaining our current lifestyle. We are taught that if we are not constantly working, that we are lazy or unmotivated. So many people are overworked and underpaid and this can lead to stress and unhappiness in the workplace. But what people rarely think about is the fact that these long hours lead to increases in CO2 emissions. With this in mind, it seems that long hours at work do more harm than good. I think a Plenitude Economy could, therefore, be a viable solution to not only unhappiness but also a way to slow down climate change. Such an economy would promote a new way of spending our time. I think many people would appreciate more time away from work and a higher commitment to social connection. Like Ken mentioned, other countries have actually been taking steps to reduce working hours so it can be done. However, it will take a lot of time and effort for it to become a reality in the US since it’s literally engraved in us to constantly be working. 
<br><Br>
In the second video, “The High Price of Materialism” teaches us just how negative materialism impacts our life. Materialism leads to a lower concern for nature and general unhappiness. If we were to change the way we operate, like the previous video had argued, we could see a growth in the number of people who care for the environment. This unhealthy desire for more comes from our sense of insecurity and the increasing presence of social media. The video explains that promoting intrinsic values can counteract consumerism. I think if we focus on self-growth over becoming rich, that we will be able to lead a much happier and a more environmentally friendly life.

I agree. The problem lies in what has been ingrained in our minds as a society. As you said, we are defined as lazy if we are not working extreme hours a week, and we are not “successful” unless we are working a high paying job and living in a mansion. This mindset will be the downfall of our Earth as it is passed down from generation to generation. And I get it. Parents want the best for their children. With such high pressures from society to live up to, they want their children to do well in a competitive world and have a better lifestyle than they themselves had. The problem is the definition of that better lifestyle. Instead of it being defined as getting that high paying job or buying the big house, we should measure how many close friends we have in our lives, our physical health, and how happy we are. So this is the point in the comment where you're thinking “Ok, hippie”, and I know, it sounds cliche. But it's true. We need to shift our mindset away from consumerism. I know it will be difficult, and honestly, I have doubts about whether or not the United States can achieve this mentality shift, but it is crucial to our health and well being that we figure out what is really important to us and fixate on that instead of how much we can buy.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I completely agree with your comment that American work culture is constant and often "overwork"  culture. After watching "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" and "The High Price of Materialism", I came to the realization that materialism is essentially compensation for overworking Americans. People feel the need to buy things, things, and things, more often when their lives are unfulfilled as a result of long and underpaid work hours. It is our economic system that discourages social interaction and encourages work. Long hours are a must in order to survive in today's financial state, because the money doesn't compliment the hours of work in any occupation. In fact, the existence of money is what the entire cause of the climate crisis if, but that can be dived into another time. People need to get rid of their connection to money and its made up value. Unfortunately, this cannot be taken literally because you would not live a decent life with no money, which of one of mankind's greatest evils.

I personally never knew that longer workweeks let to higher CO2 emissions. It's crazy that we are raised to think that working ourselves to death is normal. Most people are so unhappy with their jobs but continue to work anyway. Obviously, people need to work to support themselves, but if we made it so that people could make the same amount of money and worked less, I don't really think that their productivity levels would go down that much. Personally, if I'm at work for a really long time I am so much less productive by the end versus if I were to have shorter shifts. Another thing that I didn't even think about is that longer work hours means people get to see their family less. My parents are immigrants and have always raised me to eat dinner as a family, but all of my friends with American parents never eat dinner together. They say that their schedules just don't line up. It's so crucial to have quality time with your family, even if it's just for 30 minutes every day.

I really enjoyed "Minimalism" and the other short videos that followed. I think that it is so easy to caught up and lost with the fast pace of today's world. We trade family, friends, and our community for things that ultimately add little to no value to our lives. I am one for the gift of experience and I think a minimalist lifestyle encompasses just that: Living each day to fullest and prioritizing adventures and others over material goods and one's ego. I found great joy when moving away to college in being able to donate what I no longer needed and take the essentials. I also liked thrifting for the appliances that I needed to furnish my dorm room.

Of course being mindful of what we buy is not the whole story, but I think that if we apply that mindset to our everyday lives we can make a lot of changes. As was discussed in the Economy of Plenitude model, people work way too much, buy too much crap, and are incredibly unhappy. We have this one life time, the last thing I want to do is work it away and leave with lots of regrets. I love the idea of growing my own food, doing DIY projects, and actually knowing my neighbors. It always seems that what is best for the environment always fall in line with what is best for us too! 
<br><br>

Our current economic model sucks for everyone except the 1% and capitalism has done a great job at convincing people that the harder you work the more successfully you will be. However, it is pretty obvious that this has become a hegemonic idea that has been religiously promoted by the upper class as it continues to favor them and line their pockets. I think we ought to challenge this idea and live in a world where communities are not marginalized and where people do not work like slaves.  Seeing what we could have has inspired me to vouch for an economy of plenitude, because we owe it to the environment and to ourselves to have happier, healthier lives.

I enjoyed the films as well and I agree that the way that life is right now is very easy to get caught up in wanting more and more stuff. This is all due to what companies wanted to achieve, they market for our constant demand with wanting to be satisfied. I agree that living each day to the fullest, not to make money to buy more stuff seems like a way better way of life. And I think this all leads back to a phrase my mom would always say “Money doesn't buy you happiness”. 
<br><br>
I agree that being mindful is a very important aspect that everyone should put more effort into. Like the two main characters mentioned they own a few things, but they are nice things that they really love and that’ll last them a long time. I think this goes along with working too hard just to buy things that do not give any value. In fact people are losing a very important value that is time. This is what I thought was very interesting when they talked about Sweden, that their work weeks are 30 hours. I agree that this extra time would be great to do DIY activities and having a garden. 
<br><Br>
I couldn't agree more when you said that society believes the harder you work the more successful you will be. This is what people think about when they want to come to America. Just as you said this is not true, America favors the upper class. This upper class who not only controls many aspects of society but they also consume a major portion of it. During this week's assignments all I could think about is Kylie Jenner. Not only is her house massive, but her closet and number of cars is enough for a group of people. This shows how consumption by the wealthiest needs to change in order to make a difference environmentally.

After watching the videos about visualizing a plenitude economy and about the high cost of materialism, I can see that not only is changing our lifestyles necessary but in the end it is the most beneficial. Because of the cruelties of capitalism and the consumer culture it pushes on society, we are all forced to work tirelessly to be able to afford things we think we need. (Of course, capitalism has even made it difficult to attain the things we do need in order to survive without having to exploit people, animals, and the environment). It has always pained me to see my mom work so hard every day and see her completely drained on her days off, never being able to fully relax, all to give my family the best life she can. But it shouldn’t be like that, while yes it is good to be a hard worker, but that is different from working oneself too hard. By implementing a plenitude economy, we are taking minimalism to a whole new level, one that won’t just benefit us on a personal scale, but on a societal one. People won’t have to work themselves to death just to survive and afford things they don’t really need. People will spend less time at work and spend more time with their loved ones and doing things that make them happy that doesn’t require mass consumption. There will be a fairer distribution of work, more people employed, and a more balanced distribution of income as well. This idea of a plenitude economy sounds like an overall better, more sustainable way to live. 
<br><br>
   As the materialism video argues, the more materialism rises, the concern for pro-social values and the environment drops. People are so concerned with owing items, they don’t even realize that with the path we’re already on, these items won’t save them from the climate disasters that are (and already have) come. Every time you are about to buy a new article of clothing or other useless trinkets, ask yourself: do I need this or is consumerism telling me I need this? We all need to reevaluate our choices in order to see that happiness is not found within materials but within ourselves.

As a concept goes, minimalism seems to be the push back against the rampant consumer culture that is ever present within our society. The desire for more more more has really shaped the way we assign value and declare success. However, as we saw repeatedly within the documentary, more doesn’t necessarily mean better. As stated, beautifully by Jim carry, ““I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.” This quote, to me, echoes the theme of the documentary and what the “minimalists” were touring the country to convey. Having money and the ability to purchase pretty much whatever you want won’t make you happy. The void that is ever present in our society cannot and should not be filled with new things. That’s one thing I really have a problem with. “New” things, the newest smartphone the newest car. No matter what industry you find yourself purchasing products from, there will inevitably be a new product down the line that is seemingly leagues better than your current one. The advertisement of these products is specifically done to make you want to go and purchase the newest thing because you will feel like you are missing out without it. Where I draw the line at least when it comes to advertisements is the advertising of seemingly useless products to defenseless children. The marketing of products at the current scale, investing billions of dollars towards advertisements focused on children is not only scummy, but predatory. While this documentary highlighted many things that make the general public miserable, I don’t see a future where living in a tiny house and getting rid of all unnecessary positions will ever happen in our current consumer society. The best we can hope for is that people try their best not to buy as much useless stuff.

“Can we maximize minimalism?” I think the simple answer in American, consumer society is no. This film was the first time I felt I was greatly contributing to the climate crisis. Online shopping is one of my favorite pass-times, I have an entire dresser drawer for the soul purpose of bikinis, and I don’t remember the last time I wore the same article of clothing more than once in the span of two weeks (which would make the 333 challenge quite difficult for me). The minimalist approach sounds endearing and genuinely made me reevaluate my life priorities. But how do I do this? Get rid of the abundance of useless things I spent an abundance of useless dollars on and start fresh? Seems reasonable, but I haven’t even been able to part with my high school prom dresses from two years ago because of “sentimental value.” Just writing that last sentence made me cringe. I do believe that my generation has a different stance on this need for more, a view that is more understanding that what is portrayed in the media is often an unattainable reality. I never considered how advertisements directed toward children have changed and companies have spent $17 billion in the year 2016 targeting this susceptible audience. I really appreciated the attitudes of Josh and Ryan in the film. Even when their way of life was challenged, they calmly responded with a smile and offered their point of view. Although I hope Americans will live a more minimalist life, including myself, I’m not sure how many will follow this idea.

I agree that, for the time being, it seems unlikely that America will adopt this minimalist lifestyle. Minimalist supposedly makes one’s life better and more simplistic, but there aren’t many people who will be willing to take the chance to find out. As mentioned in the film, the American Dream began as a concept of opportunity, but now its success is measured by the numerical amount in one’s bank account. We equate money with happiness, but what are people going to do once they realize that is not the case? Minimalism. 
<br><br>
However, I, too, am guilty of owning way too many items that I barely use, and then ending up hoarding them because I can’t bring myself to throw it out. Although I understand how Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus say some people shop to fill a void in their lives, I think that applies to extreme cases. When I purchase an item that I have been wanting for a while, it brings me genuine happiness and excitement. Still, though, I can see how this could be dangerous if a person is unsatisfied with their life and only has materialistic items to bring them joy. I find it more likely for Americans to adopt this minimalist lifestyle in order to improve their own lives and happiness, rather than for the sake of the environment. Even though that is slightly disappointing, I believe and any and all efforts that contribute to reducing climate change are important, even if it is for different reasons.
<br><br><hr><br>
I think a lot of Americans live a very similar lifestyle to this-- getting excited about a purchase they have been wanting for awhile. But is this actually “genuine happiness”? I know I have thought I felt this feeling before, but I really hope the happiness I get from buying a new pair of pants isn’t one of the greatest joys life has to offer. In fact, I know it’s not. I agree that any effort to reduce our carbon footprint is a step in the right direction, I just hope it’s not too late.
<br><Br><hr><br>
You're right; as excited as we get when purchasing a new item, there's so much more to life that cannot be fulfilled by materialistic possessions, as Millburn and Nicodemus mention. I think most Americans would agree that relationships and purpose in life can bring greater happiness than mere items, but we tend to forget this. Promoting this concept in our culture could be so beneficial to reducing consumerism. Not only that, but it would also help mitigate the climate crisis, and overall create happier people within our country.

I’m far from a minimalist. I know it’s a big problem that I need to gradually change, but I’ll admit that it’s hard, very hard. A few times a year, I’ll pull a few shirts or pants out to donate to Goodwill. These few times are so challenging for me because my heart is always pulled in so many directions. On one hand, I know that these clothes will be put to much better use if donated; however, I always find some way to reason myself out of parting ways with my clothes. “This shirt has sentimental meaning because it’s from the softball tournament I won.” “Maybe one day I’ll need this shirt for a special event.” These are the constant thoughts that flood my head while decluttering my closet. I’m sitting in my closet for hours, yet I only come away with a few t-shirts that I’m willing to part with on that particular day. However, it’s progress, and I'm trying. Everybody needs to try.
<br><Br>
One tip that my friend taught me to declutter was to take some of your belongings and hide them somewhere in your house. If you don’t reach for them for a few months, you most likely won’t miss them if they’re donated. It’s a strategy that I’m in the process of implementing, and I’m hopeful that it’ll help me on my path to becoming more of a minimalist than I currently am.

<br><br>
After watching this film, I’ve realized that minimizing the things that I own is so important -- not only for the sake of the climate, but also for the sake of my own happiness. Every possession that you own should serve a purpose, and it should bring you joy. We need to learn to do more with less because this will treat us best in the long run.

The film “Minimalism” is quite informative and intriguing for me. There are several scenes that show the fanatical consumerism, such as one episode depicting people crowded before the supermarket, waiting for its opening and rushing to the sale items. I wonder are they really happy and contented if they snag the sale items, even that cost them so much time and energy and make them look like animals? Another short segment catches my attention is that two women are screaming and fighting with each other just for snatching a stuff in the store. I find that the truth behind these scenarios is that stuffs control people and dominate our life. Stuffs are equivalent to social status and meaning, which push us to buy more expensive and fashionable things to show our trendy tastes. Minimalism criticizes the blind consumerism led by numerous advertisements and celebrities. The minimalists in the movie show us their stories, and how they become so happy because of their simple lifestyle. While they get freedom with less stuffs, they also contribute to the environment simultaneously. Reducing unnecessary things could make us feel better and also reduce the burden of our planet. Also, I could connect the film with Thoreau’s book, realizing the significance of choosing a simple and genuine lifestyle instead of following the tide of consumerism. For myself, I can start with simple food and less clothing, which could make me more contented. However, I find that most people who become minimalists are relative wealthy and use to have great jobs. It seems a pattern that when people become rich and leisure, they start to consider minimalism. This phenomenon confuses me and I am not sure whether minimalism can be spread to more people. Also, minimalism in my stereotype is a trend for elegant people to show their unique lifestyle and demonstrate their distinctive living attitudes.

After watching Minimalism the scenes that stuck out to me the most were basically the ones you described here of Americans fanatic consumerism.  The scenes of massive crowds of people pushing over each other on what I assume was black Friday should have been surprising and upsetting to me, but sadly were entirely unsurprising.  American consumerism has reached the point where we have entire semi official holidays devoted just for shopping, and the buying of items we don't necessarily need.  The film really highlighted how much of our culture is based around buying products to solve supposed issues with ourselves, be them physical mental or otherwise.  And on a cultural scale judging ones worth by their salary, success in industry and amount of purchasing power we emphasize all the opposite characteristics that we would like to say we strive for.  Equality, environmental awareness, and general happiness are all at odds with a society that judges ones worth based on the price tag of their shopping cart.  
<br><br>
That being said it was refreshing to see how the Minimalists were not urging everyone to give up all their worldly possessions and live an enlightened meditative life like a monk.  They tackled the issue of over consumption in a very reasonable way, basically just saying that the "over" part of that statement was the issue.  There of course are going to be some products, some things we can buy, that will genuinely increase the enjoyment of our lives and that we will frequently use and appreciate.  But the distinction is how selective we are about these things, and being able to tell if what we are buying is something that will actually help us enjoy our lives or if it just another false attempt to buy our way into easy happiness.  It isn't always so easy to tell at first, but by actively putting thought into what we are purchasing and why we are purchasing it will help us save money for more important things, get more use out of our possessions and ultimately be happier.
<br><br><hr><br>

After watching “Minimalism” I too was engaged by the fact that people are in need of so much love, happiness, and fulfillment with themselves that the closest thing to accomplishing it is by consuming stuff. I agree that the part where the two women were fighting over an item was shocking. What I observed by this scene is the example this generation is leaving for the younger generation. Children are growing up seeing people compete over material stuff and this leads them to believe that if we don’t get that item, then our sense of worth goes down. I admire that the film connected how minimalism is not only about helping the environment but also finding the value of who we are as individuals and what really defines our happiness. As someone who has been slowing practicing this method, I can say that it’s definitely worth it. Over the three or four years I’ve only bought new clothes and accessories when I actually need them. By doing this I have saved so much space in my closet, money, and feel better about not investing in textiles that are harmful to the environment. Just like the film stated that if an item doesn’t add value to one’s life, then it’s not need it. Once you fully undertake this statement it is when you start living more peacefully.
<br><br><hr><br>

I think you made really great point as to how Minimalism criticizes the blind consumers. The advertisements that are being fed to the public are influencing them in a way that makes them believe that the things that they have now aren’t enough. Another thing to include is how in society, success is based on the amount go things we own. You also brought up how minimalism is something that is now adopted by people who are relatively wealthy and had great jobs. That is exactly what I’ve noticed too. I think it brings up a really eye-opening fact that money doesn’t bring happiness, but for some, money is something that people need in order to get by. So, there is this dividing factor between social classes that kind of puts things into perspective. 

<br><br>
I really was fascinated as to how the film was able to really get through to viewers. When looking at minimalists closets, it really forced me to think about the one I have at school and the one I have back at home. If I’m being honest, 99% of the clothes I have back at home should be donated because if I was going to wear them I would have brought them to school. However, despite knowing this, I have been really conscious about the clothes I buy. Now, I really don’t buy clothes unless I really need them. I typically invest in pieces that I can wear back in forth, yet still be fashionable.

Before watching this film, I've heard about minimalism from the news, my more "granola" friends and some of my educated/retired friends and family. I heard them talk about it and from the hype I equated minimalism to something that was life changing, hard to do, fundamentally radical and a societal "statement" that was meant to combat consumerism. As I watched the film, I realized this was not necessarily true. Minimalism is not something radical nor hard to do. It is thought that offers a way out of consumerism— a way to escape. Now I see minimalism as something I want to practice. I want to live a life that is not entrenched and determined by advertising and huge corporations. I want to decide what will make me happy and not let societal pressures force me to think one way.
<br><Br>
Growing up I did not own a lot of "stuff" yes I had some toys but my parents spent the little extra money they had on experiences/travel/family time, and for that I'm deeply thankful, because it instilled in me ideals that align naturally with minimalists.  By watching my parents and learning to value what they value,  I'm naturally repulsed by extreme consumer culture (fast fashion, black friday, capitalism). I don't need the newest iphone or that really common patagonia jacket that all the other white boys wear. The one sweatshirt I like will do just fine. Although, I continuously feel pressure from peers, social media, and movies that reinforce the stereotype that I NEED to have the newest and most in "style" clothes. New clothes do feel nice but ultimately I know that I only buy them for others to notice— for others to see my "status". Truly, I am disgusted with this. I want this to change and I feel like the way to do this is by embracing minimalism. I think I'm going to try and do project 333 and see where it takes me.

I think everything you commented was really well said. I have also thought of minimalism as something that was too big of a change (even though like you, I do not own a lot of stuff or follow the must have trends) simply because I thought of it as cutting down to one pair of pants and one shirt due to how some media portrays it, such as this film. When it spoke about Joshua Millburn packing for that camping trip and not even having to bring a bag because he was already wearing all the clothes he owned, I think that is what throws people off and gives them a misconception about what this lifestyle should actually be like. In order to make a difference in society, it is not necessary for everyone to change this radically and remove everything that makes them happy in life. What should be illuminated with this idea is give and take factor where we should be taking away things in our lives that truly don't make a difference in order to give a much greater positive difference to the world. 
<br><br>
Im afraid its the unfortunate truth however that enforcing this in people worldwide won't come easily because of the peer pressure you speak of. The media is such a powerful source that I do not see changing its values anytime soon. Without a change in this platform, people will still rely on it to base their lives off of what they deem is "normal" or "socially acceptable". No one wants to be the outcast with a tiny home and less than a bags worth of clothes and its going to take a lot more work to find the happy medium in people. I think that if models and influencers started a minimalist trend of fashion it would be much more likely to catch but someone needs to have high enough power to reach them first, and so far it appears no one has been able to do that. I honestly do not know what the solution to this is because I truly think that people will not change unless they see a change in others first and that must start somewhere and we, so far, are going nowhere.
<br><br><hr><br>
I feel like in some way this documentary made minimalism achievable for the fact that everyone’s minimalism is going to be different. As long as everything has a purpose and you are living an intentional life, that’s all that matters. So yeah I agree, it’s a way to escape consumerism. I thought it was interesting how minimalism is bringing people together. Growing up I used to share all the time and then something happened in middle school where I didn’t want to share anymore. “Oh my DS… yeah no, you can’t use it” or  “No insert sibling name here you can’t wear my shirt!”. So after watching minimalism and seeing how if the woman needed a dress she would just hit up her friends. Something so obvious as asking to borrow a clothing item for one event was clouded by the pop up ads stalking my search history. 
<br><br>
Unlike you, I didn’t grow up living a simplistic lifestyle and not to say our family had a lot of money either. But now thinking about it, my mom would sacrifice her paychecks to allow my sister and I to fit in. Sure it would take a while to save up, but my mom never wanted my sister and I to be alienated because we didn’t fit in. Now thinking about my past life, I can totally see that we were victims of capitalism. The next new toy was on my next birthday or christmas list.
<br><br><hr><br>
I really enjoyed reading your comment! I too had heard of the film from friends and family before watching it for this class. They talked about this idea of "a simpler life" as if it was so out of reach; something they themselves could never achieve. So just as you, I started the film almost skeptical of the minimalist's way of combating consumerism. And man was I surprised. Minimalism is not out of reach nor is it just an idea thrown together by a couple of free spirits, or as you put it, "granola" friends. It is a a way out of the confines and restraints consumerism has put on our lives. It is a way to escape from the social pressures of keeping up with the new style or getting the newest model/version. 
<br><br>
I loved how the film kept referencing the origins of consumerism and the way in which it has sneaked its way into our everyday lives. The explanation of the fashion industry - there once were 2 seasons to dress to in a year and now there are about 52 - blew my mind. But in all honesty, it makes sense. I hate to admit it now, but I am definitely guilty of trying to stay on trend or wanting to keep up with a certain style. Now, after watching this film, I understand how these "trends" and "styles" are just illusions created by the fashion industry in order to make more money - to keep us coming back to the stores. We don't actually need all of the clothes and items we buy. The Minimalists did a wonderful job of reiterating this throughout the film. 
<br><br>
Lastly, I would like to say that I too have been inspired. I agree that getting new clothes or an expensive item contributes no real value to our lives. Sure it might be nice, but it is not necessary. I too want to challenge myself to to cut down my wardrobe and get rid of items that I don't need. Many people think that material possessions will somehow add too whatever is missing to their lives. After watching this film, I want to fill my void with adventure, love, laughs, and the satisfaction of making myself happy through human interaction, not through the purchases of materials or a 6 figure salary in the future.

Minimalism in my opinion is an easier way to organize one’s life and declutter the built up stress that comes with having so many possessions. One of the main takeaways that stood out to me was when the idea of having material items trying to make us feel whole leads to the continued consumption of more and more items. Without realizing it, I am also a victim of this. When I get tired of my clothes and miss the excitement I felt when first wearing them, I go online and look for that same feeling. This is a horrible habit not only for the environmental impacts but also for my well being. That feeling is destined to go away, and from this point on want to vow to focus more on relationships with people not items. This film shocked me and made me remove myself from the society that I live in everyday and made me reflect. With that I became very emotional and overwhelmed. I don't want my happiness to depend on material items, but I am guilty of wanting to succeed in life and make money to live in “comfort”. My dream of being a lawyer stems from passion but also is a goal due to the economic status. It is not that I want to buy more and more things and that is why I want the job, but I want the economic comfort. I am starting to think that the idea of economic comfort in my head is made up. My outlook of comfort before the film is much different to what I think comfort means now. This movie really put into perspective how much of the things that I use everyday are useless in the grand scheme of things. Living in a dorm room really restricted how many of my “essential” items from home I could bring, and I can truly say that I feel free with the less items I have. I really did not notice that I am missing the poster on my wall or the cup of pencils on my desk. I am really interested to see what Ken says about this film next week and more of the environmental impacts. During the duration of this class, I have been making many more efforts to live sustainably. From drastically changing my diet and religiously using my hydro flask and other small things, I am really seeing a new lifestyle form. This minimalist perspective is interiging not only for the economic impact but for the personal changes that these people in the film have described. It is alarming to me that this kind of concept did not come to me before watching this film. Sometimes I do wonder if I need this and if I need that, but my connection to some of my personal items is frightening to me. With that, I vow to change my expectations of the way I consume and the way I do consume for the sake of the environment and myself.

Similarly to you, I too can admit that I practice many of the same concepts highlighted in the movie. Often times, when I buy clothes, I have a small period of time where that’s all I want to do. I want more. I’ll wear the clothes I just bought because it’s exciting and then as soon as that rush goes away, I want to buy more. However, if I let time pass and resist the urge to buy more, that feeling often goes away and I forget about that want to constantly buy new things. Having things to do all the time, mainly going to school as opposed to being on summer break, I rarely get that urge. It’s when I’m not doing much with my life that that urge comes crawling back. This movie definitely helped me reflect and helped me realize that I need to stop shopping so much and just be content with what I already have, considering I already have so much.
<br><Br>
As you mentioned, moving into a dorm room has definitely helped with the consumerist side of me. I obviously can’t have everything I had at home, because of the restricted space. That being said, I still feel like I could cut out half of the things I have here and be just as happy. However, every time I try to declutter, my thought process often leads to “Oh, well I should keep this in case I need it one time in a very long time”, which is super dumb because it’s rare that I ever encounter that specific scenario where I need that one specific item that I never use otherwise.
<br><Br>
When it comes to clothes, one thing I’ve noticed with the fast fashion industry is that the quality of clothes simply isn’t the same anymore. My grandma will show me her clothes and I’m always blown away that her clothes can even last that long. But that’s the thing. They should last that long. But in this day and age, clothing companies purposely make their clothes cheap, not only because they can then produce them in mass quantities, but also because they want people to constantly buy more. As soon as a shirt rips, it’s time for a new one. If clothes were better quality, we wouldn’t have to buy so much so often. That is another reason why it is important to shop at thrift stores and second hand stores, because often times, items are of much better quality.
<br><Br>
Something that really spoke to me was the line that Joshua Fields Milburn said at the very end: “Love people and use things, because the opposite never works”. It’s something that seems so simple and true, but our society has completely distorted. Through countless advertisements and the idea of the American Dream, our society has started cherishing things just as much, sometimes if not more, as people. And that’s insane. You often hear people giving advice along the lines of “If he/she doesn’t love you back, then it’s not worth it, you shouldn’t be putting in so much time and effort into someone who isn’t reciprocating those feelings”. If people are saying that about people, then why have we started loving and putting so much value into things that most definitely will never love us back. We need to learn to let go of things and learn to love what we already have and more importantly, love the people around us.

The Minimalism movie was for me, quite compelling. Yes, the film was assigned to us for en environmental reason, but I found the film as well as the reading to be more about happiness and fulfillment than environmentalism. While I don't think mass amounts of people are going to convert to tiny homes or fit all of their possessions into two bags, I think the message of minimalism can still be important. If enough people change their consumer habits to only buy what they need, not what they want, less waste will be generated, industry will have less power, and people will be overall happier. I hope in the future, minimalism will become "cool" and people will begin to realize that their is more to life than buying the newest iphone or keeping up with fashion trends. On that note, I found the fast fashion portion of the film to be particularly, for lack of a better word, stupid. I can't imagine how people have the time, patience, and money to keep up with weekly fashion trends. This is not only destructive from a mental health standpoint, as people are under constant pressure to look good, but it is environmentally destructive as the textile industry is among the most resource intensive on earth. Buy less stuff, be happy with what you have, and look up from your phone every once in a while for god's sake.

I also found Minimalism quite compelling as well as inspiring. In partial thanks to this film, I am beginning to understand the idea of having everything you (thought) you wanted not ever being enough. I found the idea that owning many unnecessary things has a negative effect on our happiness, particularly fascinating. This caused me to reflect back to times in my life when I was stressed or unhappy and my immediate urge was to clear away of all the clutter on my walls, desk, in my closet and under my bed. I never really understood the compulsion, but this film shone a very interesting light on it. I think minimalism is a very realistic lifestyle; maybe not in the form of tiny homes or 33 clothing items, but in generally smaller homes and only buying/owning/consuming what we need. I for one love the idea of buying fewer, but much nicer clothing items in favor of many cheap things. For my apartment next year, I look forward to trying to implement having as few things as possible and sort of view it as a fun challenge/goal for myself.

Adding on to what you are saying, I completely agree that people need to realize there is more to life than getting the latest iPhone or buying the latest and “hottest” fashion trends. Advertising plays such a large role in this, especially when it comes to highlighting the newest technology. Apple is very strategic in the way they show off their latest products; there is no way you can live in a big city and not see a ginormous billboard featuring the newest iPhone or even watch the news on television without seeing a commercial that features their latest and greatest camera. It brainwashes consumers into thinking they need to latest technology to fit into this society when in reality, their 1 to 2 year old iPhone is working perfectly fine. Same thing with clothes; people see advertisements and mannequins that show off a new style, making consumers think they need new clothing in order to fit in with society and look good. I hope society can refigure not necessarily into tiny houses but to lifestyles of being content with necessities.

Lately, I've been experiencing this feeling of hopelessness and a feeling of being stuck in a society that is always expecting us to be working, to be producing, to be consuming. I keep asking myself "how can I feel more fulfilled? and how can I ease the constant stresses of everyday life and the thought of looming disaster?" Minimalism really helped me clarify a lot of those thoughts. It's true--we get so damn caught up in everyday life and so many people think that in order to be successful, fulfilled, and contributing members of society they always need to work A LOT and consume A LOT. 
<br><Br>

Something that stuck out to me was that people are "living for a paycheck" and "living for stuff" and it's so true. We're constantly bombarded by advertisements and a media portrayal that more stuff will make us happier--it encourages us to maintain that addiction to stuff and I very firmly believe that it's a direct result of living in a hyper-capitalist society. Stuff, everything from clothing to home appliances, is becoming more and more available and cheaper to people and we feel the need to continue buying because we feel we need to keep up with the latest trends. There was someone in the film who said "you can never get enough of what we don't really want" and holy crap that is SO true. We think that buying more things will make us feel happier and give us a sense of fulfillment because that's what the media has portrayed it to be like but it doesn't. 
<br><Br>

Something else that was brought up was that people consume a thing in part because because they work so long and people don't find fulfillment in their jobs/occupation and so they need some way of telling themselves that their work is amounting to something more. It's true. Have you ever gotten your paycheck and gone straight to the store to buy a new outfit? An outfit that you probably didn't really need, but wanted to buy because you thought, perhaps unconsciously, that you feel better about yourself or make you feel like your hard work has paid off. I know I've done this before in different circumstances. Truthfully, I just did it this past weekend. I had a stressful week so I went to Tillys tried on a bunch of clothes and walked out with stuff that I probably could've gone without--but it made me feel better in that moment. I feel like a lot of my closet is just clothes that I bought in moments where I wanted to feel a sense of relief from stress or feel better about myself, but I only end up using them once or twice. The clothes I buy--or will start to choose not to buy--is something I want to be more conscious of. 
<br><Br>

I think a lot of people would be able to relate to the idea of compulsory consumption and its negative effects. I'm not saying we should stop consuming and that consumption is inherently bad, but, like it was said in the documentary, the issue is that we need to really care about the materiality of goods rather than their symbolic meaning. We, or at least people who decide to consume more consciously, need to be more deliberate about the things they buy. It's hard though. I know I want to buy the newest, trendiest things sometimes to feel like I'm keeping up but I feel like it's a process people can decide to undergo for themselves.

Shout out to Ken for assigning this film because I totally logged off all my social media as soon as I finished the documentary and I feel relatively relieved to be honest. So...thanks.

Wow I think its amazing that you were able to log off all of your social media. I honestly don't know if that something I could bring myself to do at the moment, nor would many others. I resonate with you because I too believe this film was inspiring and it gave me an outlook on life that I had not previously explored. Do you ever feel like even in going to college we are essentially living for a paycheck? While an education is very valuable, obviously thats why we are here, at the same time the reason many go to college is to secure a well-paying job. People want financial security but I feel like The Minimalists show us the best of both worlds. We can achieve financial security if we limit our consumption and buy intentionally rather than mindlessly to fill a void. Why is it that we live in a time with the highest standard of living yet so many people are depressed? I think we should start searching for value in people rather than things. We should get passionate about something and let it drive us rather than being driven by a dollar sign. 
<br><br>
I changed my major recently because I realized my idea of success was shrouded by the prestige and financial capital of becoming a doctor. When I was younger I think I picked that career because I thought I would make a lot of money and people would be proud of me. Although this is a noble profession and I commend anyone with the intelligence and work ethic to pursue it, I realized that it just wasn't for me. I want to make change and help people who live the most minimalistic way in underserved populations. In the documentary it said you shouldn't live with too much or too little. Imagine if all the money from too much consumption was channeled to communities that have too little, like too little access to health care. People have a right to life. The consumption epidemic is also a matter of public health because our means of consumption is polluting our planet. If we even attempted to live in compliance with minimalism we do do a whole lot of good.

The opening scene of the movie was eerie. Hoards of people under the rage and manipulation of consumerism. It was crazy to see how “stuff” can make people go crazy and run people's lives. I believe there are a few parts to the idea of mass consumerism. People want as much stuff as possible. But why? Yes, it is part of the culture of america and has been passed down from generations. However, I believe it has a lot to do with seeking comfort. There are alot of people out there that believe that they will only be happy if their wrapped in silk sheets driving a G-wagon while somebody drops grapes in their mouth. People spend their whole lives chasing that image in their head, but that will not make them happy. Buying stuff is trying to fill holes in your self esteem and trying to fix all the deep rooted problems and insecurities you have with yourself through buying stuff. This is not the way to be happy. Chasing comfort (which what consumerism is) will NOT bring you happiness. 
<br><br>
THe human animal that we are in our DNA needs constant stimulation. We have evolved hunting for animals, chasing our food, survive the elements, and thrive in our conditions. There is a great feeling inputting challenges in front of yourself and overcoming those challenges. You need to push through hard challenges, doing tasks, learning lessons, accomplishing things  in order to tap into the deep rooted evolutionary stimulation. You need to struggle to reach happiness. This is how you reach happiness. It's not through buying stuff or becoming as rich as possible, it's about becoming the best version of yourself possible though setting goals and accomplishing the goals. When people aren't doing anything besides working they feel like shit. And they feel like shit, so then they rely on buying stuff to fill the holes that are in their mind.  I believe this is the deep rooted cause of consumerism.

The thing that I truly appreciated about "Visualizing a Plenitude Economy" was the fact that not only did the video provide actual solutions for how to create a plenitude economy, but the solutions themselves are not way too extreme, in fact they come across as extremely plausible. Not only are shorter work weeks most likely very enticing for many Americans, but encouraging people to explore their passions in ways that benefit the environment while also spending more time to creating connections within one's community seems like a plan that everyone can enjoy in their own way. Similarly, in "The High Price of Materialism" it seems as though the main message is that in focusing on intrinsic values and things that make us truly happy, not only can mankind work to change the state of our climate from an environmental standpoint, but can also change our social climate as well. Not only does our society's obsession with consumerism have dire effects on our environment, it also has strained our ability to connect with others on a deeper level. The fact that $150 billion is spent each year on consumer messages as stated in the video truly shows just how much prominence is placed on consumerism and materialism in not only the United States, but in many countries around the world. While the shift in ideology that "The Price of Materialism" is advocating for seems plausible and even enjoyable in theory, I have major doubts that the United States will be able to come to a consensus to do so anytime soon, though it's very evident that this change needs to happen.

I agree that the points made in "Visualizing a Plentitude Economy" is not a radical idea, and I was extremely enticed by the solutions offered in the video. Americans are so obsessed with being the person who is working the hardest, arguing over who is the most stressed out. My mom, who is not American, always points out how it seems the more unhappy, the more overworked, the more tired Americans feel the more they feel accomplished and they will make sure to let you know that if you didn't sleep much last night they DEFINITELY slept less. The average American only gets approximately 2 weeks off of work a year, which is almost inhumane to me. By law, the European Union gives every employed person 4 weeks off of paid leave. Though I want to say it's crazy that a country such as the United States prioritizes churning out products and overworking their citizens over their well-being, I'm not surprised. Our obsession with "growing our economy" and buying everything in sight has got a hold on us and is the face of the American Dream. It is time we change that.

Joshua Fields urges the public to, “Love people and use things, because the opposite never works” and I believe that he is one hundred and ten percent correct. In today’s society we attempt to buy our happiness. We have this longing for more; however, the more we have, the more we want. As humans, we are never satisfied. Material goods mean social status to us because we have become brainwashed by advertisements that give an illusion of a perfect life through overconsumption. We are no longer living as the concept entitles but we are living for things, objects. We need to change the “bigger is better philosophy” in order to feel a sense of content. Our current lifestyle is not only hurting us but hurting the environment around us. As a society, we need to come to the realization that money doesn't buy happiness.                         
<br><br>
 The question is, “Is minimalism a viable and meaningful option?”, and the answer is yes. To be a minimalist means to let things go that do not add value to one’s life. If we let go of the things that no longer serve us, we are essentially letting go of the weight that is holding us back. The extra weight that keeps us from being happy and feeling whole. To be a minimalist means to live more deliberately with less. Quality over quantity is key. We don’t necessarily have control over our income but we do have control in our ability to spend less and have fewer things. I agree that we need to stop loving and having an attachment to material things and instead start loving the people around us. Minimalism is a meaningful option because it diverts our focus from stuff to human peace and connection.

I too believe that when Joshua says, "love people and use things because the opposite never works," that he is one hundred and ten percent right. So much so that when he said that I paused the documentary and wrote typed it into my notes app because I wanted to truly remember this and tell this to others. This documentary enlightened me to the totally plausible way of a minimalist. I'm not a minimalist by any means, but I have given some thought to it, always deeming it too hard, or completely unrealistic. After watching this, it was made clear that minimalist still have some things. They keep what adds value to that person's life. This point really showed me that they are doing what makes them the happiest, which to me, was extremely admirable. I really liked how you phrased, "to be a minimalist means to live more deliberately with less." This was straight to the point and felt like it kept only what was essential ( kind of sounds like minimalism). Something else I really found thought provoking was when Joshua Fields made the point that, "all the clothes [he] owns are [his] favorite clothes." Through some self realization and after looking through some of the comments, it is clear this is not the case for us all. I know for sure I definitely have some clothes I don't wear as much. I began to ask myself, why did I even buy this in the first place? I maybe wore it once, and it's been sitting in a closet since. I know for a fact that I've gotten various pairs of shoes because they were cheap, they were on sale so I couldn't say no to the deal, yet only end up wearing them a few times before they begin to collect dust. This documentary revealed to me the issues with thoughts like these, and will hopefully help me to be more mindful of what I truly need in the future.

The Minimalism documentary discusses the American ideal of overvaluing materialistic things. The producers of this documentary both come from similar backgrounds as well as working together in the corporate world. They find happiness in minimalism because it allows their mind to disconnect from an orthodox mindset and truly begin to appreciate the wonders of life. The pursuit they make to start a new chapter in life is courageous and unique. 
<br><br>
Relating to this class, living a sustainable lifestyle as minimalism would greatly benefit planet Earth. Putting your personal interests first when shifting to minimalism is ideal. The byproduct of living simply is, of course, climate action. By choosing to buy fewer clothes/cars, you are contributing fewer carbon emissions in return. According to the documentary, American families use about 40% of their home space but yet still manage to rent storage units. Bigger in America usually means better, it comes to no surprise why Americans indulge themselves with unnecessary things they don't require.

At UCSB, I believe most of the students living a rather minimalistic life. Usually, students room with a few other roommates as well as using biking for transportation. MInimalism is a concept that is tough to accept for people living in the city/suburbs.
</p><hr>


<p>
I do believe minimalism is a very important response to the modern issue of climate change. Having read Thoreau before for my APUSH class in high school, I already knew I very much like the idea of minimalism. I remember a new wave of minimalism starting with Marie Kondo's "Tidying Up" on Netflix. It got a lot of my friends talking about the idea, and encouraged me to decide what objects were important to me. In truth, I found that I was hoarding a lot, and was surprised about how much I had that I truly didn't need, and about how much better I felt when it was gone. I know that we are trained to pride ourselves in what we have, not who we are sometimes. It's literally insane.

<br><Br>
In portraying minimalism as a mental health/happiness movement, as opposed to a climate issue, people are taking it up more readily. Because it is politicized as left or right, a lot of people are much more open to trying it, as I was. So many people, as seen in the video, claim that the real way to happiness is to be happy with yourselves and others instead of your items, and I really would like to see those changes in consumer culture. I was surprised that the video stated that minimalism could bring communities closer together, and took up the technology issue as well. I feel, and I think a lot of people feel, that we as a society have become disconnected from one another, and I really do find it sad that it's hard to talk to each other. In sharing our minimal items, as opposed to everyone having one of everything, we really could cut back on spending and put more time into our relationships with everyone else. Call me a socialist for saying we should share, but I think it could fix a lot of the communication issues of our generation. Living closer might also help us find more friendships, maybe we would be happier with added human interaction. Who knows?
<br><br>

As far as "maximizing minimalism", it is a hard bargain. I don't think everyone is going to want to downsize. The current American dream is to have a McMansion, and have enough material items to fill it. I think we were indoctrinated to want this too, and to feel entitled to it. But the reality is that is not sustainable at this rate. And its probably for the better. Jim Carrey's quote about money and fame not being everything hit home for me. If someone with exponential fame and money can attest to it not being fulfilling, I think he is saving us the time of trying to find happiness in our materialistic wants. Not necessarily everything, but the things that ultimately don't matter.

Before watching the film, I was always thinking about give it try to be minimalistic some day, cuz in my previous opinions, minimalists are avant-garde in the society, leading a new fashion and representing cool thoughts. But after watching this, I realize this perception has always been false, even offensive. The biggest though-changing point I get from the film is that minimalist is not a cool style, nor should be used as a fashion in  clothing, design, etc. According to the intro video by Professor Hiltner, it is voluntary, with those relatively wealthy people trying to consume less in order to chase for freedom and better lives. It is now a cultural movement intending to change the rampant consumerism in the conception of American Dream. 
<br><Br>
In the film, the two leading minimalists Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Millburn introduce their thoughts and experiences along the way promoting their new book. Instead of being exposed to theories and research about the topic, I was glad to hear them sharing how they became minimalist. Their personal emotions, experiences--bad childhood, mom’s death, and divorce --all build up their paths to find an alternative way regarding the definition of happiness, which then contributes to be minimalistic. One thing that shocks me is their baggage--they only carry two bags during a 10 month trip! Relating to myself, only my toiletries and cosmetics can fill up a whole bag! So what they’re doing is really impressive in my eyes. 
<br><br>
Another thing is about the status quo, or the social symbolic value of each thing we purchase today. I’ve learned from my sociology class last quarter about something between the fast fashion and environmental inequality. But what the film told me today makes me truly think about it. According to the scholar Juliet Schor, we are “not paying the true labor cost and ecological cost” to the sweatshops. Consumers are led to buy more frequently when the old ones have “no social values”. The price of the apparels goes down, creating more and more waste and carbon footprint. This is an extreme and profound unsustainable way of living and actually it is detrimental not only to the environment, but our psychological health. We try to compare everything with each other, gradually build a delusional craving in our minds, and care only what the object symbols rather than the true materiality of goods. And in fact, we, especially women, are affected by this fast fashion culture more in life. I strongly related to this feeling, always being afraid of “out of date”. But after getting to know this unique lifestyle of minimalism, now I decided to give it a try, cuz having less means craving less, and craving less means a better life, and a better world!

I completely agree with your comment, especially when you said that it's wrong to look at minimalism as a cool new fashion trend when in reality, it's a way of life that far more people need to convert to in order to save our planet. The problem with viewing minimalism as a fashion trend is that something never remains a fashion trend forever, so it's worrisome that wearing used clothes and shopping at thrift stores could soon cease to be considered cool or on trend, therefore leading to even more consumerism and popularity in the fast fashion industry. Though I do shop at thrift stores, I too worry about wearing clothes that aren't in style and so I do end up giving into the fast fashion industry at times. However, thanks to English 22 and this class I am far more conscious about what I buy and am forced to ask myself whether or not I need something, or just want it.
<br><Br><hr><br>
After I read your comment, it refresh my idea about Minimalism. After I watched “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” I realize our costs of life today are way too high. For example, everybody around us has shoes and clothes more than we need. Most of the stuff are made by plastic, and as we all know, it's impossible for we recycle or decompose the plastic. As we use more and more plastic in our life, our earth would suffer a "plastic disaster". Last year, the queen of the Britain had declared war on plastic. It shows that it is necessary for us common people to do something to protect our earth.
<br><br>
In this film, the two leading minimalists Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Fields Millburn only bring a backpack for their trip, they introduce their "Minimalism" experience in this book instead of giving useless theory or thoughts. I was surprised that how can a person only a bring a backpack for a month-trip, if it was me, a backpack is only enough for my electronics and wash bags. I feel same with you at this view. That's why we have to work hard on our daily cost to pursue "Minimalism".

I hadn’t watched Minimalism before this, though I had heard of the concept. The idea of the pursuit of what is necessary to our happiness, rather than pandering to societal and industrial marketing, is a strong argument. Perhaps the greatest loss with our modern society is our loss of individualism. As people increasingly pander to societies expectations in how they dress, spend, act, and idolize celebrities, individuals have a consequently more difficult time breaking from the mold which these expectations build for us. Breaking from these expectations in a desire to lead a more focused and less materialistic life is a meaningful pursuit. I appreciated that the film investigated the effect in-which minimalism not only helps ones general happiness, but also helps address the growing worry of climate change.

I agree that one of the greatest losses in our modern society is individualism. Nowadays, it is alarming to learn just how much control society has on our day to day lives. We do not realize it but our phones, media, and the people around us are influencing us in ways that direct us towards a materialistic life. Media tells us what “we should want” and once everyone around us conforms to this lifestyle, we follow suit. People are definitely pandering over how they “act, dress, and spend,” and I agree that celebrities play a key role. One example would be the shoe industry. If a celebrity is seen wearing a particular model or brand, the media and the public are quick to jump on the new fashion trend. I believe that by pursuing minimalism, humanity will be able to become conscious enough to gain back some control in our decisions. Personally, I will admit that I am an impulse buyer. Whenever I see something that I really want on Amazon or in a store, I do not hesitate to purchase the item. However, when I reflect on how I felt after purchasing an item that I really wanted, I have learned that I am not truly happy. Leading a minimalist lifestyle seems like the right path for the pursuit of genuine happiness. Rather than letting the materials in life dictate how happy you are, I would much rather use my time, effort, and money towards making connections and relationships with others. I really enjoyed how the film showcased how a minimalist life can contribute to fighting against the climate crisis, but also pointed out the positive psychological impacts it can have on the individual.
<br><Br>
Although minimalism sounds like an ideal lifestyle that everyone should develop, I do not believe that it will be easy. The past generations have adopted the consumer culture that is so prevalent today. Fast fashion, luxurious mansions, fancy sports cars, and the overall expensive lifestyle has become a part of the capitalistic society in America. I believe that individually we will be able to switch to a more minimalistic life. Economically and politically, however, will be incredibly difficult. Companies will engineer tactics to prevent people from achieving a truly minimalistic lifestyle. Politics will view minimalism as a step backward for humanity and refuse to pass policies to enforce the road towards minimalism. Ultimately, it will be down to the individual. By individuals, I do not mean a couple or a few hundred people. Everyone must do their part in not buying into the consumer culture for minimalism to make an impact in our society.
<br><br><Hr><br>
You’re correct, it is a strong argument for minimalism that it has such a positive impact on our lives.  It’s very interesting.  Using minimalism, we will only obtain what we need and eliminate what we do not.  It causes us to look carefully at what we purchase and whether or not it is something that is vital, becoming more critical of what we consume.  Some people go to the extreme and only live out of one bag of clothes.  However, with minimalism, the possibilities are endless because people can choose the degree to which they decide to take their minimalism.  I love how it really takes the power of objects and puts it back into the hands of the people.  No longer do people have to prescribe to the societal norms of consumerism.  With minimalism, not only would people increase their happiness and decrease their materialistic wants, but people will also decrease the financial burden with everything they would have previously felt necessary to purchase and can lead to people finding true value in their lives.  As humans, we often have unlimited wants while having limited means, but with minimalism, it provides a solution by creating limited wants and working with the means available.
<br><br> 
In addition, it is amazing how minimalism can lead to increased creativity because people now work to live with limited resources and materials, so they look to see and discover the multiple uses of a variety of objects.  It is truly a lifestyle of discovery.
<br><br><Hr><br>
In relation to minimalism, I think your point about how we as a society have lost our individualism is extremely important when discussing the need for consumption in our society. We seem to now purchase goods at an extremely rapid rate because we no longer only take into account the individual gain of a material good, but now buy on impulse in order to fit societal standards and boost our social status which is increasingly being defined by what we own instead of who we are and the relationships we have. A statistic that was mentioned in this film that proves how much society is overspending on items that they truly do not need is the fact that the personal storage industry has grown to a 2.2 Billion square foot industry. At the end of the film, one of the interviewees spoke on what needs to change in order for us as a society to become less wasteful and more environmentally conscious and effective with what goods we buy. She said how we need to appreciate more the material value of goods and thus only buy products that serve a purpose in our lives and reduce the amount that we buy for other reasons such as to emulate others, raise social status, or satisfy our need for satisfaction through consumption. In other words, consuming less is vague and doesn't just solve the problem of our society, instead we need to make the right decisions when we do consume so that we are living in a less wasteful and efficient manner. And in this film, not only is it presented how this lifestyle could help the environment but an even bigger focus is on how minimalism can improve your own life and increase your own happiness as it looks to free your hapiness's dependence on material goods.
<br><br><Hr><br>
Like you I had heard of minimalism, but didn't have a good idea of what it was really about. I had been called minimalist by some of my friends and family because I like a clean aesthetic and simply have a lot less stuff than them, so I simply thought that a minimalist was someone who doesn't have clutter. In my case, I have a wireless keyboard, mouse and phone charger to avoid cables. However upon seeing this movie, I realized just how wrong this notion was. Minimalism is not about cleanliness. Rather cleanliness is a byproduct of peak functionality. Minimalism is about optimizing your life and ensuring that all your belongings serve a purpose. Everything else is just a bonus. 

<br><br>
 I'm the type of person who keeps something until it breaks and really enjoys quality over quantity. I had my last smartphone for five years, still have my first laptop, only buy shoes every one or two years, and still use my freshman year high school backpack. Upon watching this video, however, I realized just how often I fall into this consumerism trap. When I went to buy new shoes last fall, there was a 'buy one get 50% off on the second pair' sale going on and I bought two pairs of shoes. Three months later, I have only used those extra shoes a handful of times. This video has taught me how the fashion industry and others like it have employed tactics to get us to buy new stuff we really don't need. In the future, I'll be sure to justify every purchase to myself like: "What will I use these extra shoes for?"
<br><br><hr><br>
Minimalism has a variety of benefits for society as a whole. It would reduce waste, reduce general expenditure, and preserve happiness. As they said in the film, there are a ton of compromises one can make to preserve what is actually valuable in their lives. For example, those stacks of books that one has lying around. You are encouraged to keep them because they actually add value to your life. You don't necessarily need those thirty pairs of shoes in your closet, nor the twenty pairs of sweatpants or hoodies -- keep what is actually worthwhile to the experiences you create as a human being. 
<br><Br>
If we all adopted the minimalist lifestyle, then we would be happier in general. We attach so much meaning to the inherent value of certain objects when we should be attributing value to the experiences we make. If certain material objects hold value, then keep it! The only issue that I see with wide-spread minimalism is the potential risk to the global economy. The economy is fueled on purchases, so if we all stopped purchasing random things, then how would the economy thrive? Would we have to revert back to a barter/trade system or wait for economic collapse?
<br><br><hr><br>
I totally agree with your comment. I think that the idea of choosing happiness over consumer desires is a very strong argument and should be taken into consideration by the developed world especially. It has more benefits than what I thought it did before I watched this documentary. Minimalism can help the environment on a very large scale and even more than this helps people find their true meanings in life, lose the stress that is not benefiting them, and be overall happier human beings. The people in this documentary seemed so much less stressed and so much happier than the people around me and me included.
<br><Br> 
Although I think the idea of minimalism is a very important and strong one, I also think it is extremely difficult to enact in a society so consumed in materialistic thoughts. Everyone cares about the newest fashion trends and wants to own more than everyone else. To change this, we need to change the whole mindset regarding consumerism. People need to see the horrible impacts of consumerism and materialist values and take small steps towards the minimalist lifestyle. Not only will it decrease their own stress, it will (as you mentioned) make them more unique individuals and not worry about following the most influential celebrities and fashion icons. If people just looked into the idea of minimalism, maybe they would consider some parts of it, because I think that not enough people know the true benefits to minimalism to really want to switch to this environmentally friendly lifestyle.

You are right. People in today’s life are largely affected by the wrong value. “What is the ideal life? What means successful to me?” I keep asking myself this question, and it seems that I still cannot come up with a satisfied answer. As an international student, I seem to have made my judgment unknowingly：Studying abroad, getting a relatively higher diploma, gaining a decent job, and earning a high salary...is that an attractive life? Is that really what I want? Maybe, or may not. I am not entirely sure yet. According to Rick Hanson, people nowadays have the highest standard of living, but why do people still yearn for more material? We can't deny that a lot of people are sort of greedy. When they get the first thing, after a moment of satisfaction, that thing gradually becomes stale and then people crave a second similar but relatively novel thing. Ironically, that is one of the ways the economy works in some decrees. Advertising further fuels this trend, bringing luxury and colorful life to the screen and telling people, explicitly or implicitly, that this is the “real” life and that everyone should pursue it. I was shocked when I see the crazy behaviors of people on Black Friday. However, do people need this stuff? More money and stuff have no positive effect on people’s happiness after a certain level of wealth. As mentioned in this film, blind consumption may bring you a short time of happiness, but it comes with endless miserable. We try to find true happiness, but in the end, we seem to have only gained more pain and confusion.
<br><br> 
Minimalism is a novel perspective put forward in this film that tells us that we can achieve true happiness through other ways rather than buying things. Instead of purchase some dispensable stuff, we should buy what we need. When we get rid of these distractive things, the pressure will be released. Many examples of minimalism were mentioned in this film: living in a tiny house, traveling with only 51 items for months, and wearing 33 items for the whole month that even no one realized. However, these people did not feel unsatisfied. Instead, they were happy and feel relaxed about it. Although this film seems to have few things to do with environmental issues, I believe that by rational consumption we can not only get into a healthier life style but also limit the waste and reduce carbon emissions. After watching this film, I rethink my attitude towards life. If my desire will never be fully satisfied, why not change the way, put down this desire, cherish what I already have. However, changing people's thoughts and values is a long process, but at least the film points a viable direction to the audience.

I strongly agree your opinion above, I believe that after watching is film, I had a whole new concept about what minimalism is and what can it contributes to our way to seek happiness. Before I watched the video, I just simply thought the minimalism is to have abstinence, to deprive people’s wants. Also, I didn’t believe minimalism can be related to happiness at all. I use to wonder how can people to be happy if they don’t have anything. 
<br><br>
However, this video proved me wrong. It revealed the down side of consumerism and the frustration comes with it. As the video says at the beginning, many people are living in a void, an emptiness, because they were been told to “be successful”. Under the influence of consumerism, the only way to be “successful” is to have stuffs, lots of them. This led many people to lost their purpose of life, they think that all they have to do is to have better stuffs, so they can have a better life. However, the video shows that there are multiple ways to obtain happiness. If you try to reduce your want and try to find contentment, you can also find happiness.

Like you, before watching the film I had heard of minimalism, but either ignored it or paid little attention to the arguments for leading a minimalist lifestyle. Now, after having watched the film, I feel compelled to change the way I consume. Not only are there numerous emotional and financial benefits to living this way, but it is also quite clear that there are environmental benefits as well. Less consumption, evidently, leads to less pollution. The film mentioned that the clothing industry has shifted to an environmentally disastrous model -- instead of a 4 season/year catalog it is now a 52 season/year catalog. I had always noticed how quickly trends seemed to change, but seeing the severity of it was alarming. The amount of waste that our addiction to consumption is causing is astounding. We waste our money, happiness and time on new things and, at the end of the day, our health, bank account, and the earth is worse off. 
<br><Br>
I think this film presented the idea of minimalism in the perfect way. Although it hinted at the environmental benefits of minimalism, it focused on the emotional and financial freedom that living with less can lead to. Because the climate crisis is such a harsh topic, presenting it in this way may motivate more people to consider consuming less. Everyone wants to be happy -- that appeals to people's innate selfishness. Someone will feel inclined to live minimally to save money or feel happier and, in turn, will be helping the environment.
<br><br><hr><br>

I also agree that the loss of individualism is a factor in the fight against CO2. In a world where social media influences daily life it is hard to not get jealous of materialistic things. It is scary to think that the end of our materialistic ways is nowhere in sight.

Why am I able to find year old items of clothing in my closet with the tags still on them? Why do I have drawers of things that are virtually useless? It’s because I am an insatiable consumer, obsessed with filling my life with things. This documentary gave a definitive name to feelings and thoughts I had been grappling with in the past few years. In North American culture, happiness and success is often defined by what one owns— property, cars, clothing, etc. Too often, when we don't measure up to the standards outlined by society, we feel like failures. I loved how in this film, the Minimalists pointed out that many Americans work just to buy the next new thing, we live for consumption. There’s a cycle that can be outlined when it comes to purchasing new things: the excitement that accompanies the prospect of buying new things, the joy upon first receiving it, and the emptiness that follows when we realize whatever we bought may not be enough to fill whatever we were searching for. 
<br><br>
A point I appreciate about the Minimalists and their message is how palatable it is to the general public. Like they said, they aren’t trying to convert anyone to minimalism, or tell people that they live their life poorly and must change. Rather, they come with the clear and meaningful message that life could be better if we limited our desire and constant search for more material items. Something that really stuck with me was when Joshua Fields Millburn said every piece of clothing was one of his favorites. This documentary inspired me to shift to that mentality. Rather than just having a lot, I’d prefer to have a few things that bring me ridiculous satisfaction. Minimalism seems to have so many benefits— emotionally, financially, and environmentally. Whether someone decides to fully commit to minimalism by moving into a tiny house, or just decides to downsize their closet, it seems that anyone can benefit from the Minimalists’ message.

I relate to you, feeling powerless in controlling my desires to fill my life with stuff, and moving on to new stuff when I got sick of the old stuff. A lot of it is undoubtedly attributed to our culture of showcasing our success with materialistic goods. The film truly exhibited this endless circle of consumption, and yet it still came off as educating and eye-opening rather than shameful towards ways of life other than minimalism. It really just opened my eyes to the idea of appreciating things that are more important and hold greater value than things that provide temporary satisfaction. It is easy to succumb to buying things we don't need in order to feel fulfilled in a moment or a short period of our lives. It is a wasteful habit, and in retrospect, a very pointless one. I know it would be optimistic to believe Americans would choose to downsize, however, minimalism should definitely be a way to reflect on our lifestyles and evaluate if our purchases are leaning towards excessive or necessary.
<br><br><Hr><br>
I agree, I too find clothing items in my closet with price tags on them and I can't tell you why I even bough it. Plus, I tend to wear the same clothing items over and over simply because they are my favorite and majority of them I have owned for over a year; whereas the new items I only bought them because I seen it at the store and I simply wanted it. Especially when I was working back at home, I would make good money and since I didn't have to worry about paying bills or rent, I spent my money on food and buying clothes and my justification was always "oh it was on sale." Moreover, being from Sacramento there's not a lot to do for free time so my friends and I would just go to the mall and walk around, so every time we went I bought at least 2 new items that I did not need; and when I got back home, I didn't feel happiness on the contrary, I felt like I just wasted my money. Now, I realized we could have gone hiking or something more productive, since Sacramento has beautiful hiking trails. 
<br><Br>
After watching the film, I couldn't help but feel guilty for the years I spent buying materialistic items that don't bring me happiness. But I am glad that being in this college environment, I'm able to focus on the things that genuinely make me happy without causing harm to the planet. Instead of shopping when I get bored, I can call me friends and spend a day at the beach. 
<br><br>
I only wish that our American culture, did not depend on materialistic items for happiness. The saying, "money doesn't buy happiness," was proven to be completely true by this film. Materialistic items (which we buy with money) may bring you a temporary happiness but spending time with loved ones and going on adventures, creating memories are things that make you happy and will never leave you. If only the rest of our population understood that concept, then perhaps we could form unity against the climate crisis; but unfortunately some would rather hold on to their materialistic items than help save the planet.

I really enjoyed the film “Minimalism” because it made me look around my room and realize I don’t wear half of the clothes I buy and continue to buy and also have extras of a lot of personal care items that I do without right now too. It made me self aware of my habits and honestly I was really disappointed in myself. I grew up in a single parent household in very low income conditions and I felt like then I valued things more. Every toy had a deep meaning to me and I wouldn’t get a new pair of shoes until the ones I had were falling apart. But as I got older, I started working because as we all know that’s what we have to do in order to survive and maintain ourselves in this capitalist society and I started buying things I never had because now I could. So while climate change is a pressing scientific issue, it is also a reflection on our materialistic culture and how we’re physically incapable of accepting the idea that we have to give up some of our material items. 
<br><br>
I loved many aspects of the film and how it touched on how minimalism is a lifestyle that can be practiced in different types of families. Whether it be married couples with lots of kids, married couples, or even singles, minimalism is something that works for them and makes them happier than they’ve ever been in their life. Watching the video and seeing the micro-homes didn’t seem like a bad thing. It never crossed my mind that the bigger the house you have, the less likely you are to actually spend time in every single space inside that house. Having less creates a sort of intimacy with the person you share things with and adds more meaning to the little things in life. But like Ken pointed out, this has to be a personal choice. I think minimalism could work if a lot more people adopted this lifestyle or were at least open to trying. It may not have a huge impact on the climate crisis immediately, but with time it’ll reshape the values of an individual and make people more self conscious and aware of the consumer choices we make which I think is definitely a step in the right direction.

The film Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things, was the most inspirational film we have been given so far. It was nice to watch a film that focused on how to achieve a meaningful and happy life. The protagonists really believe that less can be more and that being successful doesn’t equate to happiness. I thought it was interesting how you used your personal anecdote to show how as one ages, they get more caught up in the materialistic world. I remember when I was a kid and I went to the store, if I wanted a toy that my parents didn’t want to purchase, they would make me just wave goodbye and I would be okay with that. Now, as I am getting older and am surrounded by people getting new products and clothes all the time, my desire is higher to obtain those material objects.  Ads and social media allude us to believe that having unnecessary material possessions will make us feel whole and that a six-figure income is the only thing to strive for. How we choose to live our lifestyle has been crafted by what people believe is successful.
<br><Br>
It was interesting hearing the story be told by people who actually have had experience living the newly defined American dream; it makes the life of a minimalist seem more credible. Minimalism is an extreme lifestyle that people could adapt in a modified and more adaptable way. A minimalist has objects that have a purpose, they only add value to their lives and bring them joy. The thought of a lack of stress and pure happiness is an inviting idea. It is a nice concept to not get lost in the consumer world and buying things that are irrelevant; however, for me, it is not something I can see myself doing. I would love to live an uncluttered lifestyle but living as minimal as these men do doesn't seem practical in the real world. I would definitely recommend this to my friends because it was an enjoyable film to watch.
<br><br><hr><br>
I completely agree, I found this documentary really effective, as it's also inspired me to start going through my closets and de-clutter. I've had friends talk about the minimalist lifestyle before but I didn't know much about it, I kind of just assumed it was having one of each thing you "needed" and using it until it was absolutely necessary to replace it-which seemed like ea ridiculous way to live. After watching this documentary I realize-as you said- that minimalism can take many different forms depending on where you are, who you are, and who you live with. One moment I found particularly striking is when they were being interviewed and one of the authors talked about how his girlfriend lives in a different way than him, she has more material items, but they all hold value to her and are used often, it is her own form of minimalism that fit into her life and they respect the unique way each other has approached it. I liked this emphasis on how it can be different to everyone, and it shouldn't be this aggressive compulsion to get rid of all your belongings, because of how similar a mentality that is to just buying whatever you "need" whenever you need. 
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I also appreciated that they pointed out the issue of marketing items to kids- in my job I work with kids and so I notice the ads that play on the radio/YouTube/tv for them and it's shocking, and honestly really gross. It's these insane, vibrant, loud, and colorful ads that are forced onto these children who don't know any better that is perpetuating a large part of the issue, which is excessive spending on what one of the professors called "junk culture"- things made and bought cheap that you'll like for a week before you replace it with something better. I think pointing out issues like "junk culture" while also emphasizing that minimalism can take many different forms will be a really impactful and effective way to get people to reconsider their ways of living.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
Yeah, I definitely agree with you in terms of how people should really, or at least just take notice of the Minimalism movement. Society right now view that excess spending and big consumerism as a status of wealth and power, and if more and more people (even better if they are wealthy/ famous people) are willing to maybe just take away their pride and chose to live in something smaller, spend less, consume fewer things, I think it will definitely change the societal connotation of having fewer items and create a positive feedback loop for everyone to do the same. I think the only reason people work so hard to earn money is that so they can go and spend it and make themselves feel better about their societal position, but if it is OK to have less, maybe people wouldn't be buying so many things and the things they buy will have more value to them. With the demand for useless things going down, suppliers will stop producing those things and the carbon emissions will be reduced. It is just pride that is between people and this lifestyle.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
yes, I agree with you. Minimalism does not mean you have to get rid of everything but stop live a life with consumerism. Living a life with simple but necessary clothes or furniture can make you happy. Like what Ken said in his video and Ryan described in the film,  you feel free from depression,  free from overwhelmed and stressed life.  The reason to be minimalist or people who enjoy simple life is that when you buy more, you own more, and you want to have more again. This is a loop and you cannot get out of it easily.  For first-class people, they have money to buy everything they want. In fact, most of the things that they buy are wastes for them because they never use them. From an environmental-friendly point of view, they should buy less. 
<br><Br>
Also, for me, I was educated by my mom that you should buy everything you want but buy anything necessary for you. I really thank my mom who taught me to get rid of desire since I was young. Now, I never buy things that I don't need and although I have fewer kinds of new-fashioned clothes or shoes, I am joyful and easy. The film is not asking you to be a real minimalist but a call to live a simple life with constrained desire. Desire always exist and you controlled by it or you can control desire. With less desire and more necessary and adequate commodities, we can look further on how to live a better and high-quality life instead of limiting ourselves to consumerism and materialism.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I agree with everything that you said in this comment, and I can relate to most of it as well. I also come from a low-income single parent household in which I never had much but really valued what I did have. Like you, when money became a bit more available and I had some to spend, I went a little crazy and to this day I have clothes and shoes that I haven't worn much, along with other stuff that I don't need and is just sitting there. 
<br><Br>
It's hard to not want to buy things when you have the means in this capitalist society. The movie showed that it's possible to become a minimalist no matter where you come from, but it's hard considering that the reason that I'm in school as I'm sure many others are is to be successful and be able to have a lavish lifestyle. I agree with you that minimalism could work when it comes to helping the climate crisis, but I think that it's too hard to convince enough people to live that lifestyle and make a significant impact on the climate crisis.
<br><Br><hr><Br>
I really appreciate this film and see the value in watching it. I think the film touching on minimalism being able to take different forms was really important as well. I agree with the the increase in intimacy that a smaller space could create. When the idea of families only spending time in 40% of their homes came up, I knew my family probably came close to this figure as well. Both my parents came from very low income homes and now that they are older and have children I know that their only goal is to give me what they never had. I can think of the exact places that none of us ever go to in our house and having a bigger house in general definitely limits the amount of time you spend with other members of your family. I appreciate my parents so much for giving me what I have but also reminding me that I don't always need what everyone else has and this movie made me realize why my mom hates me being in my room all the time. I totally can see the benefits of a tiny home in the family, financial, and environmental aspects. I would definitely consider living in a tiny home when I'm older and can already see how much happier it would make me.
